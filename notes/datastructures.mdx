# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is a review guide of CIS 121's data strucutres & algorithms. 
Everything here is covered in class, and includes python implementations. 

## Gale Shapley Algorithm 

**Problem**: There are n men and n women who have preferences/rankings of each other. 
The gale shapley algorithm finds a *stable* matching: a matching where no women or man mutually 
prefer each other to their current partners. 

**Input:** 2D matrix of (2 * N) * N - row represent preferences of men 
and rows from N to N * 2N - 1 are women 

output: list of pairs of men and women
