My family all went Hawaii once, and my dad drove us up on a vast mountaintop to a field cleansed of light pollution, and we waited till the rosy dusk disappeared to see the stars that night. It was a pretty popular site to view the stars, and many other people were there.

I’m aware about the cheesiness of the entire enterprise of “stars”, of how everyone hops on the vehicle to pronounce stars as a vehement form of beauty, capable of extracting awe from absolutely anyone and everyone. I, to my horror, fall into the same trap; I can’t help but be comforted that this isolation and loneliness is ironically universal to all guests under the night sky. 

The thing about admiring something that is stereotypically beautiful-like a beautiful sunset or a starry night or fluffy clouds-is that you can never be sure if they’re inherently beautiful or if you just tell yourself they’re beautiful because you’ve always known them to be. I don't know, but frankly, I'm also not sure that the difference even matters.

Where I live, you can't see the whole night sky even if you tried to: it's too bright with light pollution. But sometimes, for the sake of chasing that emo feeling that I'm a tumblr teen misunderstood by the entire world, I go outside anyway, even though that seems like the very vibe/idea I usually like to scorn and make fun of.

It’s a mix of nostalgia for places you won’t go and a melancholy, resigned longing when you stare into the sky. Then I see a plane’s light gliding into the horizon, where it starts off as a bright blue light, but once you look away for a moment and look back, it's quickly indiscernible and blended in with everything else up there. I’m not sure why it’s so enticing to want to hop on and leave-perhaps it’s a form of escapism, or maybe just the allure of possibilities and new beginnings. Perhaps it’s a sign that you’re not happy with the life you have right now. I don't think so though; I'd imagine that no matter how happy I was, I'd still have a momentarily urge to want to go.

It just _feels_ extremely icky and gross to admit that you un-ironically and genuinely love the feeling of gazing at the stars and sky. But I can't help it- who doesn't?
