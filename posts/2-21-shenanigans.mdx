Stuff that I did in the last week:

- Read about the death of the [oldest Koi Fish](http://www.hanakokoi.com/) in the world that recently died, who was born in 1751 and according to this very affectionately written website, apparently the reason for her longevity was due to the love and care of the owners and that Hanako (which was the fish) was always receptive of his embraces and huggos which is very cute and wholsome.
- Watched Your Name for the first time. I think all of my friends have watched it and recommended this at some point, so I finally watched it + it's really good! I've been thinking for a while why I don't "get" anime like a lot of my other friends and I think I understand more or less why they like anime now, it's like a mixture of the reasons I like k-dramas (I think everything is just portrayed much more artistically and better than irl - but also has more ground to do some crazy shit you can't really portray irl). It also is a very ingenius plotline/way that it's written that is able to like metaphorize (?) a very specific feeling you get of missing someone you're not sure of, so overall good movie! I liked it so ty angela michael kumar whoever else recommended it.
- Started listening to aeJ and also highly recommend! It's super good background music for studying and I really love the visuals of the MV of "It just is" by Seori x Jae. On that note, I've also listened to a lot of keshi b/c they kind of feel like the same vibes and yeah - pretty good stuff too
- Finished Frankenstein. Decent book, didn't like it a ton but it was pretty fast paced and interesting (easy to read) for a old book.
- Started reading the news more after I realized I no longer have debate to keep me aware of general current events. Not as boring as I would've imagined, although I don't know how much I'll keep this up for b/c brrrrr
- Caught up with some of my old friends from elementary school + we decided to make presentations of our past 7 years for each other; not sure how that'll go but I'm really excited.
- watched "it's such a beautiful day" and GODDAMMIT this film hits different. i kinda of watched it after reading about it on an MIT admissions post and i don't exacTLy know how i feel beyond the fact that I am very awed

1. i don't know how don hertzfeldt did it but the entire portrayal is like weirdly closer to feeling like you're immersed within someone else's psyche/consciousness than any other film i've ever watched. idk like the noises and the black blobs and the way it's like a voiceover and the layering of sounds is done so well that i literally felt so many emotions for this stick figure it was like I WAS HIM and I was thERe- just go watch the trailer and you'll understand. also i loved the mixing of real life scenes w the stick figures and idk it was all so ingenius.
2. This one part of the movie where it went like red and it was all dark with relatives as bill was waiting to die there in the bed and he wished this was not the moment he had spend years thikning about and i was like 'woah'
3. the actual film was so ??? funny and not just really depressing, which is like the plot is really kinda depressing but the film wasn't, actually i dont even know if i can sum the film as any individual emotion so much as just "emotional"
4. the ending was also strangely optimistic which I guess i didn't expect
5. good movie good movie need to rewatch when i have processed things a bit more b/c i just literally finished it

i feel like i consume content for healthy things to obsess about instead of otherwise unhealthy stuff and honestly this was plenty for this week so i'm ready to go do some hw and other boring grinding tasks
