Recently delved down a deep cleaning of my computer and found these! I was wary of oversharing then, but now that most of these things are past it feels a lot more comfortable to do so.

_Thus, presenting, here are some fragments of unfinished thoughts I felt too cruddy about to post at the time, listed in chronological order..._

> **today was a good day.** 
> 
> When i woke up today it was _not_ in fact a nice peaceful drift to consciousness like I would've wished for, but rather I was yanked out in the midst of a dream by my 7:00 sharp alarm. so naturally i had pressed a dozen snoozes and before I knew it, by the time i was really, fully not-groggy, it was already 9:30. 
> 
> It’s almost an automatic trigger for me to feel terrible about falling so miserably short of a simple and easy goal that Yesterday’s Me had set. but then i remembered that it’s probably not _useful_ to feel terrible about this - a fuck-up that is unfuck-upable- an i took a deep breath in and thought, “it was probably inevitable i would oversleep since I couldn’t sleep until really late yesterday. Maybe i should try even sleeping earlier tomorrow or read before bed!” 
> 
> That was good enough to make me roll out of bed. it’s 48 degrees now, and i shoved on a hoodie, booked a GSR room, and walked out into the Quad and down Locust. 
> 
> The leaves are ostentatiously beautiful - transitioning from a faded shamrock to auburns - and walking down in the freezing breeze that whisked up fallen leaves made me recall two years ago (seriously, two whole years ago??) where we had scattered as one large human pack down the Bronx. i miss my friends - as i walked down, i pictured all the wonderful futures I'm fully confident that they would one day blossom into. And sure, maybe we would never be all together again in the same place at the same time, and sure, maybe the little voice inside me that _knows_ that i wronged them and took them for granted has _some_ merit. i didn’t fully appreciate them then before we forked into different directions, and now all i really wish for is to go back.
> 
> arriving at pret i thought about how warm and cinnamony insides of the cafe were. the barista gave me my self-serv coffee cup; usually i like my coffee black, but after a moment's hesitation i added some sugar and milk in the first time in a while - because i suddenly didn't remember why I don't usually do this? like, why would i willingly drink dark and bitter stuff? milk and sugar is tasty.
> 
> i remember when i watched one of my favorite films “about time” (i need to watch it again sometime!) and there’s the scene about the [Secret Formula to Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUB-sCiZIUw&ab_channel=UniversalPictures). there's one part where after tim relives his every day, he decides that eventually he doesn't need to rewind time so long as he makes every second out to be the best he can. so as i remembered, i said hi to the security people, and smiled a little more. and then i admired the seasons changing, and thought some more pleasant thoughts, and that somehow made me feel a little better. 
> 
> all of this is to say , most of the time, having a good day is not something i can simply _hope_ for. i need to actively create my good days in the sense that even in every single little instance takes effort and careful mindfulness, and if i fail to do those, how could i expect it today not to morph into a forgettable, grey blob of going through the motions?

> **what crying feels like**
> 
> ur brain is so dizzy from exerting your tears - you didn’t even know u were capable of exuding so much liquid from your eye sockets - your dthroat feels like it’s overflowing with saliva and brimming and threatening to spill and it’s all the pain in your back of ur throat that’s keeping it down. everything inside you feels like a sponge soaked in water and your heavy and drowning and mushy. it’s less like your acting and u feel like watching a movie from the two blurry eyes whirling with tears out onto the world  - unable to choose to cry or to stop crying, unable to think, unable to feel anything but a bone deep despair washing and absorbing everything up inside you.

> **a small venture into "love"**
> 
> recently i read the unbearable lightness of being, which is kind of a funny mixture of nihilism and hot takes on love in some commentary-style fiction.
> 
> so kundera is super depressing about how he sees love, yet he carefully packages the ugliness of his beliefs with pretty prose and graceful metaphors. he sees the world in two dichotomies - lightness and heaviness, but doesn’t think either is objectively good or bad. his characters have super different approaches on love- some heavy and some light - and all deal with consequences of some sort. this made me wonder if i perceived love lightly or heavily? 
> 
> maybe i used to perceive it heavily. do you also remember nights where you stared at the dark shadowy ceiling trying your hardest to imagine the face of death & the unknown? blood pounding in my head and feeling anxiously sweaty, i’d wholly believe that love could be the only path out of this harrowing maze of Anxiousness. so armed with the self-assurance of my imaginary future partner, i dispelled the nightmares with poor logic and unsound lies. it was the idea that i’d have someone, someday to distract me, to pull me out of a spiral, or maybe just to lay dying with me when the time came. 
> 
> i remember reading the fault in my stars, at some point augustus says, “I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you”.
> 
> there’s not much reason i remember the quote, but that “i know that love is a shout into the void” evokes an image of a small figure standing alone on the edge of a precipice, fragile fist raised in the name of love in a cry of defiance against all other odds.  it feels stupid, even pathetic to think love poses any even tiny substantial defense against the crushing weight of all else.
> 
> Later on for awhile I thought maybe love was just the piercing gaze of being raw, vulnerably seen by someone - somewhat a painful process, like exposing skinless flesh to air. i like to sometimes think of myself as a humanculous trapped in a physical body, and maybe i have this questionable belief that i feel like anyone whose ever liked me as a person has only liked the physical amalgamation of me, like a mirage, rather the confused homocuulous spirit navigating this body vehicle. and that sounds totally absurd, but what i feel inside as myself is rather different than my physical projection into the world.
> 
> there’s a scene in “call me by your name”, where elio and oliver whisper their own names to each other, repetitively and maniacally. it’s kind of a surreal, alien take on the concept of love, but it made PERFECT SENSE TO ME when i watched it because who are they but people you treat as an extension of you? kundera says that “Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost.” and this is the closest thing i’d ever believed to having soul mates - to find someone who see you for you so intensely that you truly believe they’re a part of you. 
> 
> yet, all of this makes me feel like love was some sort of fantasy-like, delusional solution to the problems i was incapable of solving myself. so, kundera would argue that all of these above beliefs are “heavy”, loaded with false expectations and burdensome faith.
> 
> so what is love, if not heavy? 
> 
> sometimes i remember that “life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.” ; when i try to conceptualize love in this way, its hazy blur dissipates. the entire process of acquiring a partner seems as easy as finding your new apartment to reside, or finding a nice fitted pair of jeans. you’ll fall in love a little at first, and slowly through the comfort of continuous notes and syllables of repetition, all together in due time. it feels methodical, even mechanical. really, all love is is finding another person you’d want to live your life with - so looking for things like compatible personalities, goals, and good qualities like intelligence and empathy is really all the extent to which you need to worry. everything else is a matter of experimentation and sheer chance. 
> 
> Of course, all of this talk of even just dating is only of the prologue, and I’m omitting the chapters and chapters that come after the “happily ever after”. And i’ve watched enough tv shows and heard enough divorce stories to at the very least think that that the slur of compromise and ugly day-to-day of disagreements are hidden behind the novel narrations of romcoms. i know reality is unromantic and unsightly, and leaves little room for innocent beliefs. and maybe that’s why i’ve learned that when you shop for clothes its unwise to buy the sparkly or trendy, but to opt for the bland and sturdy, because after the wash of time those are the items you reach for again and again.

> **new york!**
> 
> im heading up to new york on a dirty amtrack surrounded by strangers, when the ticket lady comes and scans my ticket - in a momentary shot of panic, i look down to confirm that i wasn't a completely stupid idiot (like a couple months ago when i booked plane tickets on totally different months than the correct date was supposed to be). anyway, it was correct - november 26. NOVEMBER 26?? i do a double take; it's already november 26 and the first semester of my freshmen year is drawing out into a trailing close.
> 
> it feels uneventful in some ways, the monotonous classes and tedious 160 homeworks, nights of latex formatting and GSR rooms in huntsman hall. in other ways it feels like a total mental roller coaster. i've never done acid before, but from what i read about trippinng i'd imagine it to be a incredibly concentrated and heightened version of something i lived drawn out - constantly rethinking my career goals, thinking about my purpose, feeling incredibly nihilistic and hopeful and stupid and inanimate and ingenius and knowledgable and confused. i don't know, they're not really emotions as much as states of mind, but one thing is that I felt a lot of loneliness.
> 
> yesterday was thanksgiving, and theres a part of me that is the classic societal cynic that can't help but point out a lot the thankfulness manufactored by a predetermined holiday is somehow less real than gratitude. real thankfulness isn't really words you remember to say for the holiday spirit. thankfulness is more so like the deep plummet of something in your chest. a rock overfilling gratitute as an onlooker at the progression of your life, shouting viscerally at your consciousness
> 
> anyway, i spent a lot of thanksgiving alone - i grabbed utown with joanna, baked tiramisu with brandon, watched a couple of episodes of reply 1988 and then had a drawn out catch-up session with angela. you know that part of the movie in harry potter where harry stays at hogwarts, but campus is deserted and disquienting, and that's how i felt strolling down the usually busy locust walk, or clambering the stairs of ware. but i liked it. i spent a good portion of my day thinking about the fact that life is both long and short - that its plenty of time to care about the world and milestones stop short once you're 20. its short enough to miss watching the leaves fall and turn golden already because you know there are only finite times you can do so again, short enough to not observe each intradicate designs on the ceiling in the pretty mohinian train hall that i just walked through on the way here.
> 
> i started trying meditation to clear my mind recently, and an important tenant of meditating is to let your thoughts pass gently - acknowledge them, think them, but then let them go. meditating is also largely focusing on feeling viscerally your being. feeling the weight of your legs on the ground as you stand, the cool ripping winds threading through your hair. there's the ending scene in the movie "what a beautiful day" where it is only the end of his life where he goes out and sees the leaves and the world and everything takes on new hues and lights he never appreciated before. and he doesn't want money, or TV, or the unsightlhy, ugly misery of going through the motions, because he's filled with a deep-rooted gratitute that he is alive. he is alive and he can see the skies and touch the bark and read books, and that is enough.

> **mirror**
> 
> some days, in a momentary breath of clarify, she realized that she hated herself to pieces. it was as if she felt like wimpy piece of bread at the end of the loaf, the jarred jigsaw parts crudely crafted by an exactor knife; te sad wads of paper scraps at the bottom of the recycling bin. 
> 
> that’s an interesting way to describe her emotions; it sounds rather ridiculous and overdramatic, doesn’t it? really, what’s there to hate? perhaps she could criticize herself and do better, but capital letter h H_ate_ is a overkill. but she was obstinate; as she faced the dirty watermarked mirror, the ground reeking with the stench of dirty laundry, her reflection marred by an oozing red pimple above her left cheekbone, rotting rashes of eczema crawling up the sides of her arms and swore to herself that _she hated herself_ and no-one, _no-one_ would convince her otherwise.

> **moma**
> 
> i'm dissociating very quickly. Why does everything here feel so surreal? im trapped between these walls, with echoing screams and wails and begs for attention by these dead artists - not even cold in their grave - who crave to be _stared at_. each art piece here cries and cries to have a pair of empathetic eyes pierce straight into them - honestly, unflinchingly, bravely, vulnerably - by _somebody_, anybody at all.

> **self-reflection**
> 
> Yesterday I stopped by central city to Curtis and drop by a piano concert, and within minutes into the piece, the pianist weirdly began to almost meld together with the piano into one rising and falling wave of sounds and angst and a jumble of harsh and soft tones. I thought about the scenes in “your lie in april” where they compare the notes of the pianos to floating sparkles of colors and even different seasons; though I didn’t quite understand it before, it suddenly made a lot of sense! I can say I really enjoyed the concert; music is one of the closest tangible ways of articulating the abstract blobs of my subconscious - far better than any adjectives like “angry” or “happy” or “nostalgic” can express. Something about someone doing something they’re incredibly passionate about made me feel really, really happy. anyway, i’m excited to crash at more student concerts in the future!  
> 
> Anyway, today marks the monthly goal I’ve hit towards my commitment to log my days into small bordered confines of a Notion tables; each row compactly records the time-breakdown of my day, the foods I ate, the length of sleep I had, the overall satisfaction of what I did with my time. I also have weekly reviews, where I look at the numbers I accumulated and realize gaps in things I should be doing, shortcomings of my attitudes and social skills and productivity. There’s something so orderly and uncaring about recording your days in small quantitative numbers, I feel like a mechanic fixing up broken parts or optimizing the machine of my body. I don’t know, I suppose that self betterment is supposed to be a really good and fulfilling thing? At least, that’s how I've been conditioned think for the past decade of my life. 
> 
> But frankly I’m exhausted. There must exist a limit to how conceited you can be,  or how far a line you can cross, where even I - little petty, self-obsessed me - would feel too ashamed to venture beyond. I am just tired of my so-called quote un-quote introspection, of never-ending attempts to look for  self-help, when it’s really just a form of narcissism tucked away into the deeper wells of things I can’t admit out loud. I do not want to think like this; I want to run towards the herds of people, be indistinguishable and translucent, to tangle up my feelings in tightly wound strings and yank on them so hard they could almost break. I want to feel tears brimming up inside because of the music springing back from the walls of the small concert hall were so despairing; and because the pizza I tried last week was so spectacular. What I do not want to feel is a desperation born from worshipping myself so hard that I could die from some silly little social competitions - like caring so much to be liked or hated, or feel accomplished, or dissecting words that have accidentally bruised my ego. There are only so many interesting things to find and discover in any person, and I’ve had uncovered enough of me for a few lifetimes over. 
> 
> I don’t think any of the things I’ve written make that much sense to people other than me right now, and that makes me a little sad that I still feel very incapable of communication. Recently, I made a new friend who I’m trying to convince to start a writing club at Penn with, because improving requires consistency and practice, which apparently neither of which I've had a lot of!  Hopefully it works out - for now, I’ll attempt to keep this blog thing alive :’)
