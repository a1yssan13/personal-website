man it's been so long. if you don't know me super well, this format might be hard to follow + might want to skip this one - it's just snippets from the last few weeks since i can't bring myself to write anything more cohesive or prolonged.

as the minute hand inched towards 11:00 am (the official time to depart our hotel), i looked around our room - the luggage was upright in their own quiet waiting party, there were a few dirty towels strewn across the floor, and i could hear the last frantic rustle of the search for the missing charger.

i was laying on my unmade bed, gazing up to examine the low popcorn ceilings. it was as unspecial as popcorn ceilings could be; it had jutted ridges, circling around and around in an indistinguishable mass of bumps and etches, taunting with its ugly contours. the rest of them were also packed and waiting - they were halfheartedly engaged in some stupid discussion about duck tours to pass the time. yet, above the muted giggles and duck horn sounds, all i could really think about was whether this would one day become a moment i'd desperately long to go back to. so despite however unspecial the popcorn ceiling of room 217 was, i was committed to burn it into memory.

the thing about listening to music on a car trip is that whether you really like the song is no longer relevant.

you listen to it as it's blasting in the background of a dumb conversation on the road trip in the middle of nowhere. you listen to it as you crack bad jokes at one another and point out stupid signs on the highway. you end up liking the song, not because it's anything remotely similar to your usual taste in music, but because it's the song you all listened to on that ride, together.

so you carefully preserve the song - mindful never to listen to it one too many times, terrified that it'll lose the feeling and scenery associations all tangled together in your mind.

i felt nothing at the graduation ceremony.

instead, i spent my time looking at the thousands of unfamiliar faces around me, hearing for the first time names i've never even heard before, wondering how it was possible that the quaint halls of Plano West HS could've been filled with 1,300 strange and unfamiliar seniors simultaneously. how many people were there that i would see for the first and last time in my life?

i decided to strike up a conversation for the first time with mckenna nhem, the girl who has lined up in front of me for the past 6 years by last name. we politely converse about our quarantine, school, our summer plans, and i wondered if we could've known each other a little better if I decided to say hi when we were in 7th grade.

as for the guy that stands right behind me? i still don't know their name, and i probably never will.

* * *

i don't know why and how it happened, but somewhere along the lines i began to notice everywhere they were or what they were doing or what they would say. i'm not sure how to explain the feeling, but all i can say is i am staring into a beam of blinding optimism that is equal parts terrifying and inticing. the world is again colored in ways i forgot about, and there's really nothing i can do about it.

So we exchanged lost tidbits between us as we hiked up the mountain, reminiscing over our distant past and the childhood books we used to read (Junie B Jones, Magic Treehouse, HP, etc). Sheltered under the layers of shade underneath the leaves, breathing in the clear woody air, we trudged onwards towards no destination in particular.

we're making our way up a steeper hill when someone yells a greeting at us as we pass - _how are you lot doing?_ _Fine, we're doing great. how are you doing?_ we yell back.

_Absolutely great! Today is the best day of my life!_ he shouts and i find myself laughing at this - to be honest, i'm not sure whether he's joking or not.

So suddenly the conversation turns to us asking each other what was the best day of our lives were. we talk about our childhood again, or some remote local debate touranment, and we take turns answering. I start off talking about some random vague recollection of my childhood - but it's not long before I stop to hesitate. Today, i correct myself. Today is the best day of my life.

We noticed that they would wave their arms exaggeratively to the passing cars that drove up the mountain. They said sometimes the passengers in the cars would wave back, and that it was really fun! So we all decided to try it out as we sat on a rock, waving idiotically to a series of ascending vehicles, and I think approximately 60% of the vehicles waved back.

Last week, I found myself waving to a random vehicle on the suburban Plano roads. Did random people on the sidewalk think I was being dumb? Probably yes. Would this increase the likelyhood of me getting kicknapped? Yes. But did they wave back? yes :)

and i found myself driving alone on the crowded lanes of Coit on a Thursday afternoon last week. i could feel the thud of the bumpy construction roads, and my car sizzled with cackled radio gargles from the old convertor for my family's 2004 Honda. with volume turned up all the way to 20, I belted the lyrics to a familiar bop at the top of my lungs. everything else fell away - the road was ahead of me, the song was ringing in my ears, and god was i thankful that i finally could drive.

goodbyes r hard. i know i don't have to say them yet - and maybe not even for a couple months. but the summer is looming to a close, and some nights I stay awake and wonder about the way the seperation will happen and the way the distance will grow. yet, in a way, those ominous goodbyes have also illuminated every day we spend together in a rose-colored glow - how lucky am i to have something that makes goodbye so hard? it's hard to remember that these high school summer nights are not as infinite as they feel.

anyway, it feels like im cheesin a little. the point is - life is good for now. i feel happy. i will probably not write for a while while this lasts.
