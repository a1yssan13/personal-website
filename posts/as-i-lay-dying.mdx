I've been meaning to read this book for a while now, especially because Faulkner is so famous, and I've finally finished it. It's a weird book - the language is very confusing and over-metaphoric at times to a point where its absurd that these rural teens grieving the loss of their mother could never had the strangely insightful analysis that is like 90% of this book. The problem, I suppose, is that the purpose of language is to portray complexity of thought and feelings at its very core, and while these kids certainly wouldn't have been capable of communicating these thoughts in language, they certainly could've felt this way (the thoughts the language is communicating, if that makes sense). Considering this work is more stream-of-consciousness heavy, I guess that would make sense.

Okay, onto the actual content of the novel. For sure for sure, the plot is very confusing to follow along, but it gets much better as the book progresses forward. We begin with the perspective of many children dealing with their dying mother, who requests to be buried in Jefferson. At first, the novel seems very serious in nature- grave, brooding the death of Addie Bundren. Yet, these events become so ironic and ridiculous as it moves forward at it borderlines absurdity. Genuiene characters like Addie, Jewel, Darl all end up having pretty shitty endings: Addie dies, Jewel burns his whole back in an attempt to 'save' Addie's casket, Cash loses his leg, and Darl goes insane. Yet, the most selfish character in the book (Anse) marries again easily, doesn't even do half the labor that needs to be done to carry Addie to Jefferson, achieves his dream of getting fake teeth (???). It's almost comical how big of a deal Anse makes it seem that they need to honor Addie's dying wishes to bury her in Jefferson but then immediately remarries within a day.

Disregarding the borderline nonsensical and strange plot (although, I think that's also intentional), I really quite enjoyed many of the quotes in the book. I think I have to reread it sometime, just to pay more attention to the earlier chapters of the book where I literally had no idea what was going on.

Some quotes that are cool:

> "Love, he called it. But I had been used to words for a long time. I knew that that word was like the others: just a shape to fill a lack; that when the right time came, you wouldn't need a word for that anymore than for pride and fear."

Yay!! This quote totally reflects the feelings I've thought about for a while. The way that language works (at least, from my thoughts) is that I like to romanticize it in my head, romanticize that novels and the way that words flow and convey take you on a whole adventure. But in reality, when you are feeling panic or fear, you 100% do not want to be transported there at all. The feelings conveyed for in a book are so, so different than reality; it's kind of like the difference between being there in the past and feeling the nostalgia for that said past. You never really care about your present when you are present, but the idea of that time is so much more romantic than being present, but is also just very disillusioned.

> "Above the ceaseless surface they stand—trees, cane, vines—rootless, severed from the earth, spectral above a scene of immense yet circumscribed desolation filled with the voice of the waste and mournful water. "

I cannot believe Faulkner makes fun of words and then does this shit. I love the way it flows though, it sounds so artistic and reminds me of Fitzgerald's writing. I wish I could write like this.

> It takes 2 people to make you, and one person to die. That's how the world is going to end.

This quote is nothing special, but it's a very eloquent way to point out a fact I've thought a lot about in terms of how life functions. Maybe the reason that we're so desperate for love is we don't want to be the "one" that dies. We came here because of two, so are we desperate to go as "two"?
