recently, i've been preoccupied with teaching a load of debate camp. every day, i talk for hours and hours until talking literally hurts and my mind is dizzy, and then i collapse into my sheets at 8:00 pm sharp (the time i'm officially set free from unresponsive teenagers and poorly explained extinction impacts).

in the past few weeks, my days are just a long, monotonous slur of labs and lectures and office hours. the nights blend together; some days i crash at 10 pm and other days i find myself in sleepy, spontaneous calls with both distant and close friends alike. during those times, we alternate between sharing bits of our recent thoughts that keep us awake and laughing at things like google stock images of overweight sphinx cats. what is nice is that the long pauses in these drowsy convos are natural and not awkward; maybe it's because i'm too tired at 3 am to care about social conventions, or maybe it's that i feel comfortable around these people. none of us are willing to hang up first, so we edge on further into the night till light seeps through the curtains and the day breaks.

working at camp has brought me closer to people i never thought i'd cross paths with again. our lives converged once before in random mundane moments i hardly remember - the one Austin kid I hit round 4 at the Plano West Wolfpack Tournament, the preppy smart alecks i faced in the summer of 2017, the judge who dropped my school's seniors only four years ago. all of that seems like events that've occurred in a distant dream - probably because it was all during a time when the pandemic wasn't a thing.

i've been wondering about what are the preconditions and norms that makes the friends i am close to very comfortable to interact with. at some base level, i think it's a mutual, shared understanding of each other (their motives, where they came from, their background). by understanding them, I create a mental map to notice predictable behavior from them - I kind of understand how they interpret my actions, how they think about me, etc, and ultimately build a sense of trust and stability in each other if this continually aligns with my values.

maybe this is why time is a necessary precursor to a lot of closer friendships; you need a lot more data points and validation from how they interact with others, how they interact with you, etc. to confirm your expectations to yourself - that yes, this is the range of behavior I can somewhat confidently predict in the future - and i am comfortable with that.

today i decided to cut my hair, which i've geen growing out a while. this was partly because it was long and getting really annoying to deal with, and partly because I felt like I needed to change something and I didn't know what it should be.

i really really like the change! i think i associated long hair with femininity or maybe even the male gaze, probably due to my constant consumption of k-dramas with female leads that had long hair. i guess now it feels like some sort of character development; it's like a nice carthatic relinquishment of ideas that were long overdue.

anyway, my head feels much lighter which is nice!

despite the sticky summer days being as hot as ever, our passage into august is just another sign this summer is drawing to a close. as i find myself driving down Custer or McDermott, I realize that soon these streets will just be another figment of my past slaved away into memory, a place i'll return to only during the occasional winter and summer breaks or in unanticipated dreams.

thinking of college is not something i like to do. i'm too overwhelmed with all the potential variables to even imagine what the future will be like. while i feel like i should be thinking ahead, i find myself rediscovering and appreciating the neighborhood suburban streets lined with hovering oak trees or the same old ugly red brick patterned housing on every little road. i find myself becoming acutely aware of the feeling of familiarity i've taken for granted - my friends, the neighborhood Walmart, russel creek park - and i just _know_ that even though i can't feel it now, i _will_ miss it all.
