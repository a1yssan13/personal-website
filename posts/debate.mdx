I sincerely feel kind of gross writing about this taboo topic; it's probably going to be one of the very very few posts on the very thing that has consumed my life for the last too many years.

I've done speech and debate ever since 7th grade, and since I won't \*really\* consider that my senior year of debate as a full year of debate, I'll say that means I've done debate for at least five years. After considering this, debate, in a way, is one of the most knowledgeable things I'll ever be knowledgeable about in life. In fact, I can count on one hand the number of things I'll devote as much time to as I've spent on debate. I mean, I'd say I'm definitely not the best debater out there, only that I've had many thoughts about the subject.

I don't like talking about this activity anymore, mainly because when I'm not actually doing it, I've (in the past) always been the obnoxious try-hard who constantly maneuvers the subject topic back to it again and again, although I did it unintentionally. I'll make an exception for my ~abstinence~ for this special circumstance, though. Knowing that I'm slowly inching towards maybe the last tournament of my life, I'd like at least to try, come to a conclusive reflection about how I feel about it all.

Note: This post is going to be really fucking long, because it's literally a recounting + reflection of all of the five years I've done debate. So, bewarned :0. if debate is a triggering topic for you, probably good idea not to read this.

## Part 1: My Experience in a Timeline

I've journaled about this topic separately an exorbitant amount, so I guess I can probably find excerpts from each of these time periods. Anyway, I don't know; I found it kind of fun to revisit each time period in hindsight.

**Middle school (2015-2017):** There's not much to remember during this time, beyond the fact that I was as enthusiastic and hopelessly naive as ever. I was pretty much that wide-eyed and too-excited-and-tryhard-for-their-own-good middle schooler who thought they were going to have the best time of their life in the next four years.

**Freshmen Year (2017-2018)**: I think this was the first time when shit hit the fan. The thing about beginning debate for the first two years is that it's _only_ then when you have the confidence to _genuinely believe_ that you've won every debate on the flow, or at least 95% of the rounds. you debate So, it's inevitable that you're incredibly confused and feel wronged as you down a bunch of rounds, one after another.

> Honestly i feel really salty about hebron. / Its v confusin. /Like firstly im pretty pissed off at the second judge/ to be honest there was no way you could have voted for \[x team\] And i dont think he was internally biased/So what did i do wrong
> 
> Excerpt of entry from November 5, 2017

First, the way that I wrote in freshmen year is very questionable!! Like, I wrote in this form of like pseudo-poetry that (if you actually look at the way I wrote) is very very cringe-y. God, I can't believe I had the unwavering confidence of a straight, white male back then, even as everyone I was hitting was like at least two years older and probably much better (altho my younger self would probably beg to differ). In junior year, I kind of felt like all the Jasper freshmen were all scoundrels and annoying af, but I can totally see why they're that way now.

Here's some more of annoying me from freshmen year:

> Today, there was a really sudden thunderstorm, and it was the perfect cool weather after a winter, where I threw on an old tee and just went to our backyard and laid down on the grass, and kind of watched the darkening clouds pass with a gentle breeze in the background. 
> 
> It was really nice I think, because it kind of gave me a perspective that everything that I’ve been worried about, like my grades, state qualling, it was all nothing compared to the vastness
> 
> Random other excerpt January 21, 2018

This is also very gross. But, I guess I did really care about debate back then, probably because I instilled so much hope as a middle schooler and pressure to do well. Probably like half of my life was just spent on doing or thinking about debate. For context, this next passage is from the late season when we're trying to get the last few state points to qualify - and it's like the first time I experienced how terrible debate sometimes was.

> Why am I so salty wtf.
> 
> I’m not really sure how I’m handling everything, because I think my emotion stability is stretched out so thin right now that I feel like any moment I can cry but I also find everything hopelessly hilarious. I don’t know how to solve this, I wish I could jsut be a normal person and not care about it so much. It hurts to care. 
> 
> January 28, 2018: I think this is when we dropped our "qual" round to state at Flower Mound. I believe that we thought (??) this would be the last tournament we'd ever go to this year, so I wouldn't fulfill my goals of state-qualling in freshmen year.

HAHAH, I was so over-dramatic as a freshmen. But for some reason, I can really understand how I felt back then. It does genuinely suck when all your hopes begin to start all cascading down around you. I remember experiencing all the rejection pile up, and it's quite depressing to see that slowly deteriorate and eat away at your initial, fresh confidence.

> Whats keeping me going is this idea that right now is so minimal, and that i’m focusing way too much on the small details. That in a few years, it won’t matter that i didn’t state qual, or that i did debate at all, or if \[x\] wasn’t in my life anymore. I have everything i need with me, and its not gonna be a big deal.
> 
> January 28, 2018.

Ah, I was absolutely right- It does not matter less if I had state qualled, but I guess it was a necessary confidence booster to convince myself to keep try-harding. I also remember that all of us were such drama queens in freshmen year in terms of things we gossiped about, as like all these teenage things were so \*novel\* and \*new\*. Here's an entry excerpt about our last tournament that we unexpectedly went to + qualled at:

> Yesterday at Royse we qualled for state in public forum!!! I’m really really hyped and excited and asdf this is a really nice feeling. It’s like, the past few months, I’ve been so down all the time and nothing has been going how I wanted it to, it just feels so good to have something happen the way I wanted for once. I think, I put so much into debate and it was really depressing for a while, and to be honest, if we were unlucky once again, we could have easily not broken. As I think about it, we were just super lucky to not be screwed over, and I’m really really glad I’m qualled for once. But, by no means does this show were better at all than before we qualled, because I think I have to work just as hard, and support everyone around me if i can. 
> 
> Royse was such a nice tournament, because there were so little other schools, so the entire day was so, i’m not sure how to phrase it, but maybe kind of cozy and more like stress free then any other tournament (?). The school itself was really nice, because there were these huge ass windows and a light yellow bright theme, and there were vintage signs to label parts of the school. There was a girl strumming the ukelele throughout the day, and in the morning, there was a couple practicing dancing with heels and sitting together sharing headphones. I went into my rounds feeling like it was what it was, and I was gonna try my best, and if i didn’t see the results I wanted, there wasn’t anything else I could’ve done. Maybe it was because of flomo, but I was really resigned. I think I knew i shouldve been stressed and anxious in any older circumstance, but I felt barely anything. It just, i don’t know, felt really nice to be surrounded by people that I really liked, and if they didn’t want to talk to me, or even if the friendship was gonna be temporary, that was okay. Which is really funny, because through my emotional rides in debate, i think i’ve learned to accept what happens and enjoy what I had.

Okay, but can we talk about this character development? I feel much, much better about end-of-freshman-year Alyssa vs the beginning of the year, because it just seems like I'm much less of an asshole. Of course, I still complain here a lot about judge screws (which will end sometime, I promise) but I'm glad that I ended up state qualling at the very last tournament in a pretty rough year. It probably also made me very happy, because the first year of HS is when all your previous carefree-less mindset you adopt in middle school all comes crashing down.

**Sophomore Year (2018-2019)**

Overall, I think this year wasn't half bad. Much less drama and tea happened in sophomore year, just overall because people were less toxic and much more wholesome. We achieved generally pretty solid success in terms of our expectations for debate? I think sophomore year was also probably my favorite year of debate: we qualled early + had a lot of fun hanging out w mars llama (NY/LY/CK/Jason/Chetan) throughout the entire year.

Oh, we had a partner change. Angela and I became partners and Lillian/Renee became partners. At the end, I think both of us had pretty non-compatible partnerships with our old partners, not because any of us were necessarily bad people, just the circumstances and friction during some periods of time meant that our dynamics would never feel quite...right. I'd say that all of us fucked up at some point with one another, so it was definitely one of the luckiest things that happened that we had 2 teams on similar skill levels, and the switch made us all feel much better about pf in general. This was really funny though, on a conversation level because lillian/I were so mild about it all.

![](https://niehilist.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/lillian-1.jpg?w=512)

Anyway, for the first time, Angela and I started consistently breaking and getting to pretty late out-rounds at local tournaments. In sometime Septober, we won Prosper (our first championed tourn!) which was the first time I felt the reward of like, hard work. After that, we pretty much chilled out + didn't really do that much for most of the remaining local tournaments since spots were limited and a lot of other teams needed to qual. It wasn't as if we could travel anyway.

This was definitely one of the best years of debate. Not only did we get closer to a lot of the other teams in our grade (in freshmen year, I pretty much exclusively hung out with lillian/renee/angela), but we also just did a lot of fun things after tournaments w/ our group (constantly go to Taco Bell, playing board games at Sweet Hut + getting Boba, Bowling, and hanging out + playing random card games at tournaments). I still remember playing ERS at every single tournament and how my hand was burning red after, but I'd still agree to another game anyway. Very upsetting because now I barely remember the rules. And, Jason and Chetan were still constantly judging at tournaments, and I don't know, there were a lot of very entertaining shenanigans that I can't even really recall anymore. Renee and I used to explore all the school campus at the Jan tournaments, and we would find random spots in hallways to uncover secrets and spill tea.

Although, I will say that I began to experience more awareness + cognizance of my probable incompetency in sophomore year. After I went to Hockaday, I wrote:

> "Today I went to hockaday. I went in thinking that as long as we weren't dicks I would be okay. We were not, so its okay. R1 we hit \[x-beeped team\] but the interesting thing is that I thought we definitely could've picked up. Here are the mistakes I made...\[I put like a list of 5 irrelevant reflections here\]. I'm happy because even though we're 1-2 and only 4 3-2 teams break, imo, I am fine with not breaking but instead enjoying Hockaday as a tournament...I want to push selfish, bad thoughts away and be someone who support their team mates unconditionally...\[2 paragraphs about something random\]...My life is such a mess but I can't say that because I'm working towards becoming a better human being!"
> 
> 11/9/2018

First off, I AM much better of a human being than freshman year! 1. I'm actually saying "we _could've_ picked up" instead of asserting we were screwed (I'm pretty sure we thought we were screwed on the flow, but I guess i began to come to realization the flow was sort of insignificant), and I'm genuinely coming back to reflect on all my mistakes. 2. I think I just have a much better/healthy mindset for tournaments at this point forward.

Another thing I forgot to mention is this was the year that Chetan + Jason were here, so we got both of them gifts as they left the Jasper team. It was a weird experience, because I feel like I started to really enjoy gift-gifting from that point forward. The entire experience made me a lot more of a wholesome person in general, but I think I'll write about that some other time.

The only travel tournament we ended up being able to go to was Harvard, because Mac thought Angela and Pat were huge assets to the team, and he wanted them to do well while they were still at Jasper. Which, conveniently, allowed some state-qualled teams to go to Harvard, which was pretty great. Here are some of my thoughts post-that tournament.

> "It's the day after we dropped 2 rounds @ Harvard and are 2-2. I've been reflecting a lot lately on what it means to love yourself - to be honest, I'm not sure because does it mean to never hate yourself? Or just I guess be disappointed with your abilities? On the other hand, though, I feel like it's also a good thing to be disappointed in your capabilities because we're always looking to self improvement, right? Whenever I'm alone, a lot of thoughts and a jumble of feelings overwhelm me and its really exhausting to sort through each one in a semi-legible format. Recently, I've been a lot more conscious of my physical body, and I guess treating myself as a different identity as what I think I am? like i would look down and think I guess I'm alone w/ this body + identity again. it's almost as if i feel.. aloof? everytime @ debate tournaments when we drop a debate round, i guess i feel like i'm having a crisis. It's not like i'm depressed or it's more of a i just feel incredibly lonely but I don't think in an angsty sort of way? but more like i feel trapped within myself and I cant want get out but I can't. hanging out with other ppl almost merges my conscious and myself together because it's like "me" vs the world but it's exhausting how not a human i would like to be. that doesn't make sense. something i noticed just in general is that being lonely is so draining because you need to keep your brain thinking which is so difficult. it's easier to talk to others because you're really not thinking very much, just going along the speed the conversation goes aloud, which compared to everything that would go on in your head, is very slow.
> 
> 2/22/2019

Obviously, we didn't do well here. But I think it's really funny that I stopped going all 'aggro' mode against judges or my abilities or my opponents or just debate, but instead just go for very weird rants about consciousness instead. Maybe that became my go-to coping mechanism, to remind myself that debate wins and losses didn't matter in the context of most things anyway.

Although I do remember being really, really inspired by the outrounds of Harvard I watched, which were iirc Corona del Sol vs Jackie/Jennifer, and Bronx v Newton South. There were a lot of spectators (a lot, a lot) and I really thought they were the coolest debaters ever? I don't know, I think the way the auditorium worked and was set up really did something magical. It kind of sucks that 2021 Harvard isn't in real life, because that auditorium is something very rare and fascinating to experience.

**Junior year (2019-2020)**

I'd rate my junior year as probably the worst year of it all. Realistically thinking back, our skill level in the beginning of the year probably could've ranged anywhere from not getting to a single bid --> getting like 5 bids, all depending on our luck. (It's like, 1000% true that debate is super, super determined on chance in addition to just being competant). I guess something in between that happened.

To summarize all of that happened semester one, Angela and I had grinded the most we've ever grinded that summer & semester - to the point we recorded & listened to every single round we debated, gave like 10 redos on rounds we lost, had a 200+ pg card file (and it wasn't even super big-ass card pages, just small in context cards) we cut ourselves on every single topic. I might've gone mad to be honest, if I'd continued like that.

Anyway, we never did well in the first semester; like, we went to a fuck ton of tournaments, broke at all of them, and didn't ever get a single bid. For context, I feel like this hit us especially hard for two reasons: first, we state-qualled relatively early in our sophomore year, so all we really had to look forward to for the remainder of the year is junior year @ Plano West and attending bid tournaments. Second, there's a phenomenon at Jasper called the "Plano-West Glow-up" which is essentially just everyone who moves from Jasper --> West suddenly becomes really good for a reason. Compared to every other generation above us, I think our position? at Jasper and the success we had kind of set us up to expect to TOC qual because of the success all the people years older than us, just like how we'd expected to state qual in sophomore year.

Obviously that didn't happen. And here are a lot of angsty thoughts that I had during that year; I'd recall that my mindset about debate was definitely not the healthiest at the beginning. Of course, it was a learning process.

This was after our first bid tournament when we didn't get a bid (Grapevine):

> They just released pairings for GV and we're getting walked over. I'm not sad about being walked over, just more or less the fact we dropped 2 (prelim) rounds I suppose. I feel like I thought of a good analogy for debate. It's kind of like taking leaps in Minecraft Parkour. You leap and try to jump to the next step. You either breathe a sigh of relief and keep jumping or you fall down. The further you are up, the more the disappointment equals and the further you fall to the ground.
> 
> Yesterday when I was driving to PW, I was thinking why do I care so much about debate, its so trivial to my life and my future? But I feel like Debate is finally something you can grasp on to and feel physically attached to? I just think debate exists in another world through tournaments.
> 
> I can say its unfair and everything sucks but in reality it's all my fault; there's nothing I can do to better the situation but blame myself. It's so shitty because I know the problem is I cannot blame anyone else.
> 
> September 7, 2019

Alright, the initial disappoint is always the worst, and I had really no idea what was coming. I think for most of NDF and the later half of sophomore year, I'd always thought that the judge is 100% right and everything you did wrong was your own fault? Like my logic was that 1. There are super good teams that consistently win, even though they have to face a ton of shitty judges anyway 2. These teams debate better than I do 3. If I didn't win my rounds, then I was doing something wrong that they were doing right.

This is a little bit of my thoughts later on.

> Today, they told Angela and I that we were on the waitlist to go to Bronx. I don't know how I feel about such at all. In reality, I have no hopes and thoughts about debate. I know that high expectations will only be met with disappoints. Its difficult to be happy like that consistently, when debate is a volatile activity.
> 
> Regardless, I know Angela and I are always fighting for more opportunities but I'm too scared to put all my hope and effort in - I fear failure. But I shouldn't right. Failure isn't something to fear, that's what they all say. But it's hard not to fear it so badly.
> 
> October 8, 2019

Yeah I definitely had failure-phobia for the longest time. No matter how you think about it, feeling like a failure really fucking sucks, and I don't even think other people necessarily thought I was a failure; it was a self-inflicted thing. Now, in hindsight, I think that's 100% a pretty bad mentality and I've generally been working on trying to figure out a method to daily life that makes me feel the same way about myself regardless of external validations? It's really hard but it's definitely worth thinking about.

> Every single time I begin to think of debate I want to die a little more. It's because of Bellaire that I feel like such a failure - I'm so scared of confirming this to myself. Looking at all my friends around me, \[xyz irrelevant fluff\]. Everything makes me feel so bad about mysef, but for some reason, I still can't manage to be competant and I'm so lazy and this is so upsetting.
> 
> October 9, 2019

This is something right before Bellaire:

> I sound like a broken record but I keep having about nightmares about debate and I really would like to cry. Sometimes, it's okay.
> 
> I don't know if the future will be okay. Life is like you constantly struggle to chisel away at the side of a die so you can increase the odds of receiving a favorable outcome. But when you roll it, all the numbers disappear and you realize that it didn't matter what you did because the result is there and it's not in your favor.
> 
> October 10, 2019

I mean, I was a such a drama queen, but okay, this kind of hit hard. Not to toot my own horn, but I feel like this is pretty fucking well written in the sense that I can feel exactly how I felt then. I remember it really sucked, those few months.

This is after that tournament, where we dropped the bid round.

> Getting to quarters was a task that I failed. Whose fault and what went wrong is really unimportant to know - the comparison of whose fault is strangely a image that I can decipher probably, but I'm just not curious about it. I'm not that sad I suppose. I'm not sure if I adopted a much better mindset to dealing w Ls, I rastically lowered my expectations, or that I'm so used to being sad all the time it just feels normal now. I thing I'm dreading most is all the disappointment from \[X\] and \[X\].

> What I am most struggling about is this idea of merit. Realistically speaking, I'll live a comfortable life with a stable salary even if I never touch things like debate. But I feel like everything I've ever accomplished was handed to me on a silver plate and even when my parents handed me so many opportunities, I turned all of them into wasted opportunities.
> 
> People defy the odds to bring massive success. I am the opposite. Frankly, that is inherently an extremely privileged issue to worry about, but I feel so guilty for just being the lazy ass I am. Even all of the times I have been successful isn't because I work hard, it's very difficult to believe in myself or feel confident when I genuinely do not believe anything I've done is an actual consequence of my hard work.
> 
> October 10, 2019

I think a lot of my mindset is like heavily influenced by the way that Plano West is structured. Because we had like 10 PF teams and very, very limited spots for each tournament, we were just going to all these tournaments which, like, definitely breeded resentment, and I felt pretty awful about it all. Not only was I disappointing myself by performing poorly, I was like actively causing harm to everyone around me. Essentially, we were stealing opportunities from others with very little ROI.

I don't know if I feel the same way still. Obviously, most of my achievements are like largely influenced by the fact of my circumstances rather than like my own decisions. But I feel like the only thing more annoying than thinking you're successful because of your hard work without acknowledging your privilege is complaining about the fact that you have privilege. So I've just decided not to worry about it any more. This is pre-Bronx:

> Anyway, I'm not expecting much from Bronx at all - I feel like this is the first tournament I've ever gone to (or am going to) that I have 0 expectations - I'm just gonna focus on debating rounds rather than the results; there's not much else to do.
> 
> October 17, 2019

I mean this is very understandable. After that, I kind of blocked debate from my mind. I can't find much trace of my feelings about debate post-Bronx all until after Harvard. It wasn't like I didn't try though, like Angela and I still very much tryharded Nocember (for UT & Hockaday). I guess during that time, I just always felt like there was this form of void in me that generated a looming sadness that I couldn't ever fill- like I was in a state of constant dejection/disappointment. It is very dramatic, I know, but it was during then that I un-ironically began actively rejecting debate as something I enjoyed. Most of the time, I treat 'haha we hate debate' as a joke, but I think I really believed it by then.

Alright, fast forward to post-Harvard I guess (where we championed the tournament):

> It still hasn't hit me that I actually won Harvard yet. I replay moments of yesterday again and again and attempt to scrutinize every thing. Do I really deserve to win? Is debate just a sole game of luck? Is this a hallucination?
> 
> As we lifted off the flight from Boston to Dallas, I saw this city shrink beneath me. I always saw the view as romantically welcoming and a hub of people that we aren't ever destined to meet or ever know of, just simply exist with. But when I really imagine what the city is, it's a cruel place of human selfishness, of corporate greed and ruthless competition, of those clean marble floors that reek of capitalism. Perhaps when I'm older and jaded, I'll be exhausted of it all and gladly leave it all behind.
> 
> Harvard was surreal - I pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming, but I cannot be too sure even now. Whenever I did debate, it was often miserable. This year had certainly consisted of the lowest times. I guess for the first time, I doubted if I made the right choice in choosing debate. I used to imagine that the high made it all worth it and everything will feel alright. Now that this is all over, I'm not sure if this is even what it feels to be happy.

> Jackie says that we have success karma. When we do poorly at a tournament, our karma fills up until we do well, and then we are successful. At this point, we eventually lose all the karma filled and we have to do poorly again.

> Febuary 18, 2020

A couple of weird feelings about this tournament. The very first thing I told Angela (wang) after we exited the main building was that I don't think I feel necessarily "happy"? Just feel this overwhelming feeling of relief that some kind of burden or void was filled and I won't have to feel the super, incredibly dark feeling of subtle disappointment looming over me all the time. The other thing, is that in retrospection, this tournament was the catalyst of a lot of the things I did late junior year - like doing research, more involvement in BTL, etc. I guess I'm really appreciative of that, but I also recognize that it was a really, really large circumstance of luck. I don't know, I never once felt that we truly earned our champion at Harvard, not due to any individual screws for individual rounds, but more of just a feeling of undeservingness in general.

At state & the rest of the year, Angela and I really did not care very much to do prep after that. I guess I was like 90% motivated by this desperation to prove ourselves in order to fill that said void I mentioned earlier? so once we had, I feel like I lost my initial interest in just enjoying to debate/prep because of all the burn-out + negative experiences from the first semester. We still did okay though.

**Overall:**

I would say I've had a positive experience in debate. I think my experiences forced me to reconcile with a lot of my fundamental beliefs about my capabilities and myself? Like, I was forced to think about how I regard me and the things about me, which are certainly not bad things to think about. Although, the problem is, I think at the end of all of this I lost my initial love of just arguing and debating, so I think I just quit senior year because debate just felt very...empty and pointless to me.

## Part 2: A Review of Debate

**The Good:**

- Learning about the world: This is probably the single largest thing that I took away from debate. I grew up in a kind of stereotypical Asian household, which meant that (at least for me) my focus was almost exclusively put on competition math and historical dramas my grandma used to binge. I'm not inherently a lover of learning, unfortunately, so I don't think I would've been able to learn all the stuff I did without the motivation from debate. Although, I think I was one of the very few debaters on our team who genuinely enjoyed the process of prepping and cutting cards, because through researching cards I learned a lot about how organizations in society tend to act and the patterns in forces that affect these actors and decision-makers. This, at least turned out to be really important for me personally, because I like to think about random questions a lot and all this information is really relevant. Also I'm really glad I learned about debate impact weighing as I navigate what job to move towards post high school.
- Becoming a less shitty person This is kind of hand-in-hand with learning about the world. I feel like I am really largely influenced by the people around me and my environment, and there's something about using util trutil to weigh for five years that makes me genuinely care about things beyond my self interests. Like, you don't win debates if you only advocate for like "uS intEreSts" and somewhere in that journey, I think I turned into a much better person. And although this is definitely not true for a lot of debaters, I think I'm glad it was the case for me.
- My friends This is kind of one of the best parts of debate. Debaters, in my opinion, are like a very unique species of people. They're super duper smart, they generally like arguing and confrontation (or at least they don't mind it), and they \*usually\* have like some form of ego. I don't know, it's not everyone's cup of tea to constantly argue about ideas with your friends, but I personally found my best friends here. I don't think I could've found better friends anywhere else, and for that alone I'm really grateful.

- Learning to Lose. I guess debate might not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, but at least for me, it was a really big deal for a long time. So, the fact that I was not doing well for so so long I think made me learn to deal with failure and loss. I guess this is really a thing for most activities, but I think debate is one of the few activities that could've made me emotionally involved enough to actually feel the effects of like being a loser as much as I did. For example, if I did like competitive math instead, I highly doubt I would've been as emotionally invested and probably wouldn't have learned to deal with that shit.
- Confidence. This is super duper cliche but yeah yeah yeah debate makes you confident- all that is TRUE we get it MOVING on.
- Emotions & experiences. Okay this is a super interesting one, but also really underrated in my opinion. I'm generally not a very emotional person, like I think I just feel things on a milder scale in terms of my response to real life events. So, I feel like debate to me gave me like some sort of high in emotions that made me actual feel things, whether that's adrenaline, excitement, depression, happiness, bitterness, or whatever else. I know that I really wanted to adopt like Stoicism at some point, but honestly, life without emotions is really really bland and I think debate provided me with a unwavering fuel of feelings, which is pretty good. In terms of experiences, skipping school on weekends and exploring random cities is (like) uncontestedly cool + 100% worth it.
- Having cool role models This is a very hot take because a lot of people I know think that clout culture is bad for debate, but I actually really like the feeling of genuinely respecting good debaters on the circuit. In the same way that developing a crush is like the best feeling, looking up to older debaters you respect is like really (idk) inspiring. In general, I struggle a lot with identifying what exactly I want in life, so having people like materialize something you want to emulate feels like a cheese shortcut and provides a driving force, which is always a plus. Plus, GDS is a thing B)
- Speaking Order Switching Angela and I constantly switched speaking orders throughout sophomore and junior year. Most people would frown upon that, but I really did enjoy it a lot: speaking first vs second really had a lot of different pros and cons and I'm glad I could do both- be able to quickly think of logical responses but also do more strategy things for summary.

**The Bad:**

- Exclusivity + Disparities: Race, class, wealth, gender, all this shit is kind of obviously fucked in the debate community. A lot of contributing factors, of course. I personally felt like I found myself on the generally good side of the coin in terms of inclusivity (?) things, so I'm really grateful about that. I guess the only problem I had was my gender, but personally, I can't tell if my gender has affected me as a debater at all, like I don't know if we would have done much much better as males. I guess I never gave it much thought specifically in my circumstances.
- Subjectivity of Debate: One of the most frustrating things about debate that I personally experienced was its subjectivity and wish-washy-ness of every single debate round. Like, I know part of the reason why debate is debate is that you have to adapt to all judges - regardless if they're flay, flow, or lay. I don't think Angela and I prefer any of these three: all three types have judges that we find generally not great in terms of making decisions (like what they buy and what they don't). Because every single judge does not give a shit about the results of the round and you really really give a shit and there is no "correct" answer beyond the judge's arbitrary opinion, then it just makes the entire endeavor feel pointless and unfair. Like, I remember this statistic that at the TOC, almost every single outround is a 2-1 decision. Which means that with the best judges in the country, it's still almost impossible to reach a consensus on what is the correct team to up, so it's really a luck of the draw. This doesn't fair well with my mindset for most of my junior year, because I cared about the results so much, it seemed so random and meaningless to the work I put in.
- Zero Sum Nature: One thing that I've also thought a lot is the question: is debate a positive activity for happiness? I'd argue on net, probably not. The fundamental problem that is the way tournaments work is that debate is a very zero-sum game - you either win or lose. Yet, going 3-3 (which is neutral) isn't going to satisfy most people, so by that logic, you'll just be disproportionally sad the time that you spend in debate. But moreover, is wanting success on the debate circuit inherently a bad thing to want? Because in wanting to win and championing over other people, you are deriving satisfaction and joy from beating other people, which is like, I don't know- it feels not right. But even should you win, that means that every one else has lost - so are you feeding off of that? I feel as if you compile everyone's sadness together within the tournament, you definitely end up with a pile of bad outweighing your one person's happiness. I don't know.
- Speaking & Time Boundaries: This is probably why I quit senior year. This [blog post](https://www.magnoliadebate.com/blog/on-blippy-arguments-in-pf) by Nathan Witkin explains it pretty well - the way the circuit is changing is really rapid and, at least in my opinion, going in a direction that makes me not enjoy debate the same way I did before. The best way I can explain it is this: in a real life argument, usually the way that anything of these arguments is that "you're innocent till _proven_ guilty", which to me in debate, translates to "it's not true unless you PROVE it true". The problem to which \*woke\* debate judges who just think "tech>truth" is that they buy assertions without requiring any proof. It's like if I said "the sky is purple and made of marshmellows" and as long as my opponents drop and don't respond to it, the judge buys it, which I find very ridiculous. This 1) opens up the round to dumping, which is just dumping a bunch of super large impact + blippily read arguments within 5 seconds because the judge gotta buy whatever you say, right? :// 2) means that whoever can speak faster + more efficiently wins, because the quality of your proof does not matter + your argumentations skills do not either bEcaUse teCh oVerWheLms trUth. To elaborate, the warranting comparison game always will fall after the faster speaker, because as long as you dump a bunch of poorly warranted arguments on the flow, the judge treats all arguments as true automatically which means dropped arguments are all "conceded". When I first joined debate, I loved the nuances between warrant comparisons and trying to understand like the way that actor incentives worked, or I really liked thinking about argumentation + writing cases. In this type of world where you're literally just finding as many links into nuclear war, economic collapse, biodiversity collapse that are like super weak links, makes me really hate debate. I think people who enjoy talking fast and spreading though will tend to like this style better? It's just not for me. I don't think Angela and I talk fast by nature + we generally are not great at just speaking (I don't know if this has anything to do with being bilingual). Like, I think if we trained a lot, we could probably get to the skill we need to go uber fast + efficient, but we just didn't see a need to if we didn't enjoy it.
- The people: Just like there are amazing people in debate, there are a lot a lot of assholes. I will not deny that I have been an asshole before in a debate cx. Debate brings out the best and worst in people, and I tend to like people who are out of the circuit and out of rounds a lot more than in round.
- Online Debate While online debate certainly increases inclusivity, I found like two major issues that I couldn't reconcile with that led me to quit with like confidence. First, I'm like pretty positive that NSDA Campus has a feature where whoever is talking louder automatically drowns out the audio of the other person speaking, kind of how Discord works. This is extremely terrible for crossfires, because everyones just shouting at each other in the crossfires and it makes my head hurt. In the couple of rounds we did it online, we have had the worst crossfires of our entire five years of doing debate. Second, the judge does not have their cameras on like 90% of the time so this means that we can't really adapt to their expressions, but also, the judge now has like even less of an incentive than before to give a well thought decision while actually listening to the debate round. Like, listening to a debate round is hard enough, but with all the distractions of everything else going on the internet and zero accountability or pressure from the competitors, it's so easy to cheese out of giving a good decision. At least from the rounds we competed in online, we had more un-decipherable and nonsense RFDs and weird decisions than we ever had previously.

Note: If anyone's actually reading this post and if any of my takes are too hot or if you disagree, ys talk to me! I really don't know how I feel about a lot of this very certainly, so I'd be down to listen to your thoughts too :))

## Part 3: Community Changes

Here's some things that I wish that was different about the community that would make my _personal_ experience like, at least 30% better in my opinion.

1. This is probably the biggest one, but mandate disclosure and verbal feedback right after the round. I think the largest problem for me was that for a TON of rounds we lost, I never really understood why we lost and the judges kind of copped out of their feedback. I really do believe that every round functions as an educational space, and it's really frustrating not being able to ask questions to improve. Additionally, I don't even think it wastes time because now judges don't have to type out their feedback?? So 1) students get immediate feedback response and get a better idea of how to improve 2) it holds judges accountable to give a proper decision and pay attention because they will get post-rounded.
2. Judge Training: To tell judges the bare minimum about things they are allowed and not allowed to do within round, aka they ARE allowed to call for evidence, they are NOT allowed to use preconceived notions about a side to decide a round. I feel like a lot of lay judges are worried and don't know that they are allowed to see evidence and stuff. A couple of months back, I was thinking of making my own "judge's guide to PF" video, but a lot of people convinced me saying that tournaments would never send it out anyway.

I feel like both of these are like, very viable changes that tournament directors can make to make the entire activity so much better for so many people.

## Part 4: Advice To Younger Self

A lot of people say to not worry about the competition and just enjoy the friends and memories instead of the trophies. I can't say I agree; I think that caring about the results and being competitive is kind of an important lesson and really crucial part of my experiences? I also think that's inevitable; like debate is innately very competitive. Instead, here's my version of advice to my younger self;

1. Just trust that debate was the right choice, even if you will never get far or get the right results. I think regardless of whether or not I did well, once you made the choice, don't waste time rethinking about it again and again in your head because it's not just debate that'll make you miserable, but regret.
2. Read [this](https://www.vbriefly.com/2012/08/06/201208changing-our-minds/). I really really really wish I did before haha.
3. 100% put all your effort help your teammates and support them unconditionally. They are going to be your best friends + their success will translate into yours.
4. Stop thinking of prep as a burden. Remind yourself that you like it. Read whatever the fuck you want, because you'll enjoy it a thousand times more than winning on a stock argument.

Anyway that's most of what I have to say on this topic. I'm really quite exhausted of it all, so I'm glad to move on with my life. Thank you debate for everything. Hope to never see you again :)
