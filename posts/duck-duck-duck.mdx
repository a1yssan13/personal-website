so today my dad got around to taking my mom and me to lake texoma, specifically this wildlife/duck reserve that is supposedly filled with all sorts of ducks species. we came here five years ago and we'd been meaning to come back again for a couple of months now, but we finally had the chance to do so today. 

The drive there is approximately an hour long, but that was weirdly the part I was looking forward to most; the familiar silences of long backseat car rides are one of the most underrated experiences ever!! I don’t know exactly what it is that makes it so nice; maybe it’s the monotonous buzz of the highway white noise, or the ever-constant tremble of a vehicle whizzing forward, or maybe it’s just the satisfaction of peripheral landscapes sliding back further and further away - slowly if it’s the water tower in the distant suburbs, or faster if it’s the seemingly forever-running fence parallel to the road. i can't pinpoint the feeling exactly, but it’s kinda like when i used to pay the bus fare back in china not because i had anywhere to go, but rather so that i could ride the bus to the very last stop, then all the way back again to the beginning stop because idk riding the bus was v comforting. 

when we got there there were at most like 7 ducks, which was a little disappointing because five years ago there were thousands of ducks in flocks and flocks so that you couldn’t physically turn in a direction that didn’t have at least one flock of ducks. In hindsight, I didn’t know why we thought there would be ducks since it is late march and we went in december last time when the ducks were all here for the winter. Overall, i’m glad to see that the ducks are still following their migration patterns because i heard somewhere that because of urbanized parks, ducks have been changing their migration patterns and getting too lazy to make the yearly flight, so i am glad humans have not wrecked so much havoc that at least these bunch of ducks are still doing their own duck things. 

we ended up going to 3-4 different lake scenery places and while they were all teCHnicaLLy different, it really felt like the same thing. i couldn’t tell what was different about how the lakes looked, apart from that the rocks we were standing on was slightly variant in shades and total quantity and size. When i remarked this to my mom, she told me that “well, if you put it like that, all the landscapes on earth are really the same thing unless you travel to the moon or outer space” and maybe she’s right and what i need is to stop complaining and just look closer at the damn rocks instead. 

anyway, i realize that the point of going to a lot of these cool outdoor places (for me, at least) isn’t actually about storing a snapshot the vague, fleeting beauty of physical scenery but instead it’s about chasing these specific valuable and rare feelings - which to me is a conjunction of self-reflection, a sense of family belonging/general belonging, and/or a catalyst to wonder about the future - all of which i did a lot of today. Since i recently read “looking for alaska”, there’s this quote alaska says that goes like “imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia”, which is fair, but that makes it sound like imaging the future comes with an impossible fulfillment requirement and thus creates an inevitable side-effect of suffering, which i don’t think it does. Imagining the future is, at least to me, always brighter and more mysterious and hopeful than reliving the past. 

Oh, i forgot to mention, there was a pretty big and fluffy dog (a 75 lb poodle and labrador mix) called coco that came with us because she was my dad’s friend’s dog (who also came along), and she was very cute and adorable and i want a dog now. I was in charge of walking coco, but for some reason, i kept thinking about that movie “a dog’s purpose” where the dog is the narrator and has feelings and thoughts and then i started wondering if i woke up one day like the metamorphosis guy but instead as a dog, and then all these strangers kept touching and rubbing me without my consent and forcing me on a leash, if i would appreciate that. i felt so bad afterwards because i, as the walker of the dog, was essentially denying her freedom through strangling her on said leash, so i let her walk/trot wherever she pleased and i ended up feeling like i was the one that was being walked instead of her. 

The rest of the ride i kept trying to convince my mom to get a dog and she said something like “well, i don’t like the idea of a life owning another life” and i was like “yeah mom but, the dog would be much worse off like in a shelter if they didn't have an owner at all” and then my mom was like “no, dogs should belong in the wild”. And i was like “no, they would die, for instance i am glad you took care of me instead of throwing _me_ in the wild” and perhaps that was a really stupid argument becayse she didn’t really say anything back. However, I still do not think she is convinced so it seems like it is a likely no for a dog in the near future.

other weekly things:

- i read hank's an absolutely remarkable thing and it was okayyyyy i wouldn't recommend it despite all the hype I had initially expected. april is kind of an asshole and that is the entire plot LMAO
- looking for alaska like i mentioned above - the writing style of this book was very much up my alley because i just love the rhythm of John Green's writing, but i'm pretty wary for this book mostly because the entire presentation of feminism is so problematic - i don't know how exactly to verbalize this, and i could rant a lot about how it's very negative to portray this very stock characterization of the "mystery pixie maniac girl" . essentially, the entire premise of alaska's character doesn't make sense, she is a mystery existing for the purpose of being loved and cared for, and her entire existence is to serve teaching life lessons to her male friends?? like, she champions feminism but the very concept of her as a quirky + different "i'm not a normal girl" is so anti-feministic. i hate it i hate it it - when can male authors stop writing "feminist" female characters as like, angelic maniacs that are not-typical-human-consciousnesses-with-normal-feelings-like. i mean i love john green's cool and metaphoric insights into life + his references of interesting scientific or fun facts about history,,,, but when can he just choose to reveal such insights in a way that's not skinny nerdy boy chasing pixie maniac girl >:(((
- i'm reading rationality from ai to zombies and so far it's been really good barring that it is almost 2000 pages long. interesting things i've picked up on is 1) the idea of a belief in a belief vs actually just believing things 2) aumann's agreement theorem which is that everyone must agree which have genuinely translated into how i interact with other people in the sense that i am more cognizant of trying to notice if the things i am arguing about are because i actually believe in them or just believe in that i should believe in them.
- so i read the plague by albert camus recently for the intent of feeling better about the pandemic (uh it does not do this) but instead after some googling about confusing sequences of events in the book I learned that a female rat can mate with as many as 500 partners during a six-hour period of sexual receptivity, which occurs about 15 times per year and adds up to as many as 2,000 offspring in one year?? which is very fucking blebefljkajdsdfa and i don't know if i needed to know that. other than that it was a decent book?? i liked the stranger more still, but maybe it's just because i'm much older now than when i first read camus and existentialism just doesn't hit me the same anymore.
- i have done another series of paintings, which i will now insert photos of. I think I want to explore more original creations - things that are less reliant on reference photos (even though i have moved past art reference photos --> real like photographs which is solid progress). i have this cool idea to write short stories behind each painting so that I can further challenge my creativity and I think it'd be very cute to spin tales based on these scenes.
