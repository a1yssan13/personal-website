Today marks the day I start this blog (very impulsively). I never ever thought I would have a blog, yet here we are! I started this situation because I really like to write things out. My brain simply doesn't have the capacity to remember the things I have thought before, and I hate the idea of not conserving all my ideas. Wouldn't it be such a waste to simply let the thought go?

Anyway, I think the fact that this is going to be public is a little concerning to me; a stranger will be able to type up a URL and read all the thoughts I have. But it's also in a way very liberating rather than journaling in a physical book or on the "notes" feature of apple, your words are not hidden, just waiting to be found.

I'm not sure what I'm going to write here yet. Maybe a lot of rants, maybe some boring insights on my studying, maybe some existential thoughts. It's crazy how alone a person can feel and how not understood, when practically millions others are dealing with the same problems. I don't know, trying to feel like a special snowflake is quite exciting but terribly lonely.

I don't have any cohesive thoughts today, but I'll come back next time! Cheers to this newfound relationship of me n this blog.
