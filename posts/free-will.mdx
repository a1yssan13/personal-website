Sometimes I wonder how I get into these spirals of crises during the day, and I think I can recall one right now, so I'll try to narrate it as much as possible.

It's first period, 9:00 am. Mr. Carroll likes to do an activity where he gives us an very unreasonable scenario that we won't ever see in actual life, often consisting of frictionless slopes and round disks, and we have to predict questions no one really needs to know like “what is the speed of the disk” or “how many revolutions will it make”.  I get that it's for my own good/ to make me smahrt, but it's 9:00 am and my brain cannot handle this shit.

So it’s one groggy first period class when I’m calculating the trajectory of the shooting ball when it collides with a falling one. I use those triplet Newton laws that are basically worshiped by the universe, and the magical-number-I-have-no-idea-where-it-came of 9.8 that I plug into the calculator, and suddenly I’m a prophet, capable of knowing exactly whether the lever will go up or down. 

Of course, my brain decides then and there that it’s the perfect time to play its favorite game. If suppose, on a small scale, I could predict the ball’s future trajectory given certain information due to the way objects behave, then wouldn’t it be technically possible to predict all events, since anything everything is just some form of molecular matter that follows a series of rules? If our brains are atoms bouncing around, wouldn’t all our decisions be a consequence of the law of how particles move? And even if there is supposedly randomness in the equation, that randomness isn’t even a choice by us— just quantum particles fluctuating on energy levels. My thoughts spiral downwards until I reach the inevitable conclusion: everything, literally everything, is set on a trajectory I have no control over. 

It’s never fun reconciling with an existential crisis at 9 am in the morning, so thankfully, the second period bell saves me from myself and I head to my next class: US History. I’m admiring my pastel highlighters, momentarily distracted from the mildly painful facade of free will, when a familiar rhythm hits me like a bucket of ice water. Wonderful. Mrs.Zivin informs us we’re learning about predestination today. Apparently, Puritans believed they were set to live plainly, so they banished all joyful events to ironically create a self-fulfilling prophecy. My mind darts to another connection: Oedipus Rex seemed to have reached a similar conclusion where fate is his ultimate end game, no matter how much he attempted to skirmish and avoid it.

Upon further research on determinism, I learned that all our existence is apparently set from the onset of the big bang. That the beginning conditions of the universe dictate every event today—from the light snore of my neighboring classmate to the lame joke Mrs. Zivin is cracking. But exceptions flood into mind; I remember Nietzsche who says we are condemned to be free in a meaningless universe, and then decision calculus problems like the Prisoner’s Dilemma—after all, if free will doesn’t exist, can anyone even have a dilemma?

But even if I chose to believe it, what could I do about it? I still have to “choose” answers to this multiple choice test, still choose what outfit to put on, and the words I am writing. I still think about problems, because my lived experience is so vastly different. I still hope for things like the election results, the pandemic, the 2 degree Celsius brightline—because they do not feel like things I can wave away under the pretense of “predetermined fate”. With the free will I do not have, I place the insight I decipher today on the back of my mind. 

Anyway, there's no other conclusion I can possibly do to reconcile and dispel this annoyingly depressing idea. Like every other thought, I banish it from my mind, until another unnecessary trigger in my daily life will break the dam and all of it comes crashing back. But for now, I'm ready to go back home and take a nap.
