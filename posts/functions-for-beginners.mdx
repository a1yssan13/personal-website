## This is a Markdown sub-heading
We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

Here is some **strong** language. 


*This is some italicized arguments*. 


> This is a bunch of blockquotes with multiple paragraphs 
> More block quotes because I enjoy blockquotes 
>> This is another blockquote but it's nested

```
  // this is a code block
  const doSomething = () => {
    return console.log('hey')
  }
```
