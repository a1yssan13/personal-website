feeling really thankful today. here are things i am thankful for:

- the autumn trees. the trees in the quad & down locust are so, so beautiful i literally want to cry every time i leave my room. i have a million pictures of trees in my camera roll, because everytime i see more trees i just can't help but want to take more pics. which really, is a just sad and desperate attempt to preserve the scenery in some drive on my electronic device, but we all know that nothing will really compare to the real thing.
- RED. because taylor swift's lyrics are masterpieces and sometimes i can't believe that i'm this fucking lucky to be alive in the same era as her.
- the TREES are literally so beautiful that i spent way too much time walking aimlessly down random corners of campus i have no business being. but like, what else can i do when there's pretty falling leaves in red orange green and every shade in between? i literally felt a bump in my throat from the wave of emotions i felt looking at the trees but that is also likely because i am sick oops.
- people. i don't remember this very often but i do today, but my friends make me feel very very loved. i can't believe people are just so nice to me for zero reason whatsoever and i feel really grateful that despite distance and time they are still here. and that people ive just met are also so nice & i honestly don't deserve it
- the TREES ARE SO PRETTY and picturesque that i stopped yesterday on my walk and actually considered that maybe this could very well be a local if not absolute maximum of my life; by this i mean casually strolling down a quaint, vintagy-brick street, listening to super old Bon Iver albums - which was possibly better than any other future i can currently conjure. autumn will be gone soon, and that sucks to remember. i think nina lacour wrote that "we were nostalgic for a time that wasn't yet over" and right now i am nostalgic for autumn, and adolescence, and being young and confused, and all of these things are not over yet.
- did i mention that the trees are pretty?
