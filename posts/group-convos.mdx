The way that conversations and dynamics arise between different groups of people has always been an enigma to me - partially because I have an particularly acute sensitivity to social awkwardness and that said awkwardness induces a form of mild anxiety, but also because I’m constantly slightly worried and conscious about the whole situation of how much is acceptable to talk and what is acceptable to say. If anything, I try to read between the lines even when there’s nothing to see, and I still curse inwardly at my ability to react “correctly” because I often worry I talk too much. (which, in writing this post, is giving me a million flashbacks of bad and cringey interactions). Of course, when you look back, it feels dumb to worry about these types of things, but you do it in the moment anyway because… i don’t know, that’s what's always been ingrained within me as a not shitty thing to do for the sake and comfort of other people?  

Anyway, I think there’s a difference between being socially aware vs say “social prowess”, which is a term I just made up and would like to define as the ability to create conversations that are (hopefully) engaging and interesting, aka just taking that step to set up and carry out the tone of the room. You can be extremely good at the former without the latter, which in that case, I might imagine may manifest itself through in a quiet person who feels awkward but really doesn’t do much beyond fill up spaces of otherwise silence. You could also be the latter without being the former, which is what my friends like to make fun of as having “the confidence of a straight, white male” which, I don’t know if that’s an accurate description of all straight white men, but at least it gets the message across. I’ve rarely encountered both traits to an extreme degree in one individual, but there’s been some people that do come close. However, most people just seem to sit somewhere between both spectrums. 

I’ve come to realize that I prefer one-and-one conversations infinitely more than group ones; I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve never been engaged in the _right_ group conversations, where the dynamic put forth by the few select ones that like to take initiative in these types of things set an atmosphere of “coolness” that makes me feel uncomfortable and generally a little limited, even when these people one-on-one are very nice people to talk to. I’ll have to do more experimenting when I’m in college and when I have more diverse friend groups, because I really do think that the expectations and dynamics created by the people in these groups drastically impacts the way these groups operate. 

The strange thing is that I find my best friends very engaging and interesting people to converse with, but only really in isolation. Even in a relatively small group of three, I always find myself lagging behind all the action going on. It’s almost like they speak a different, faster language and I’m instead drowning in water and all I can hear is a slow and suppressed version of their distorted vowels. Or, it’s kind of like listening closely to two instruments in a duet, and then trying to hum along to its tune without ever hearing the song before. You’re always a beat too late and you don’t have the given repertoire, and so in translation to the convo, you’re always at a loss of the right words to say. 

To break down the exact dynamic of groups, they usually work as 1) one or two people take the lead of the hangout, whether that’s pronouncing a specific and often exclusive topic of interest or show a display an interest in one another’s presence 2) perhaps these two people begin talking, where they’re often whisked away and absorbed by said topic (could be a universal topic, but often not) 3) the other people awkwardly listen in to their private/public convo 4) eventually someone makes fun of something or someone in the group 5) everyone kind of agrees awkwardly, and the slightly toxic but ig ‘cool’ ? nature of the group is set. If you are not an initiator of the public (public, as in, everyone can hear your one-on-one conversation happening) conversations in this group, your role kind of becomes jumping in at the right time with the right things to say & nodding. Which, I suppose, seems to be fine? Except that I rarely find anything of interest to say in these convos that are already speeding along fine by themselves. 

I tend to enjoy instead the adaptable pace of discussion that one-on-one conversations force - that every part of it is mandatory to be accessible to both participants. I also think that both members tend to have a certain given autonomy over what is discussed, what is acceptable to say, etc. I’m not sure if that makes me socially inept, but the nature of group conversations (as someone who doesn’t like to assert my feelings and thoughts to a large group people, which is ironic because i know that this is a blog, but out loud and directly is what I mean) has really been off-putting thus far, and I generally tend to feel like I don’t belong in the friend group at all. Which, is not to say, is a fault of any of the members of the group, just more so I dislike the very idea of group convos.

This, however, is much much better and even enjoyable in larger groups. I’d say the worst manifestation of this phenomenon happens in groups of approximately 3-5, because you’re in groups small enough that you’re expected to contribute in some way to seem engaged, but large enough that not everyone can dictate and adjust where the conversation is headed. When you’re in much larger groups (6 and larger), it becomes easy to have one-on-one sub conversations within that larger group, and you’re no longer expected to chime in and more so just absorb information put out to your heart’s content. 

I wonder if this is a self-inflicted problem - that if I’d only initiated more conversations or was more outgoing in groups, I would enjoy those dynamics much more. Logically, that would make the conversation my style of pace much more suited to my likeability, but simultaneously, it could become the case that said conversation I lead is exclusive and unlikeable to other participants of the group, which is the opposite effect of what I intend. 

I guess that’s the real reason I never host birthday parties or gatherings; the entire premise of groups and group hangouts makes me feel fatigued and its like running against a train that is just, literally faster than I’ll ever go even if I tried my very very best.  

I really wish I could playback recordings and listen to how I hold conversations, and how those conversations differ from the ones in groups, and take comparative notes to see what went wrong and why I tend to dislike most groups so much? 

But I’ve certainly participated in many group conversations I really liked, or felt like everyone was engaged and contributing. And these usually have some more explicit and different norms, as many of these happen in the classroom with some sort of arbitrator? As in, I really enjoy the conversations where we sit in a circle and everyone has a chance to speak and listen to each other’s experiences, and that dynamic is so wildly different than typical hangout groups that usually degenerate into idk chaotic energy. 

At the end of the day, I suppose what all of this is alluding to is the idea that sometimes I wish I was more cognizant of other people who also don’t feel included in these conversations, because I am just as guilty of talking rapidly about topics that have no relation to others. And I am just as guilty as participating in these power dynamic plays where we have to be “cool” but it’s really just a pseudonym for being “mean” in the way we make fun of one another in a jokingly cruel way. And I am just as guilty of forgetting that all of us just want to be accepted and you don’t have to adhere to these arbitrary convo standards to be loved and cared for. And I wish I was good at that, at noticing when people are “off” and when they want to talk but can’t or when they feel uncomfortable. Because I realize I am not good at it at all, and I am also not good at being a good influence in most of these scenarios because they tend to be continuous feedback loops and it’s easier to play into that loop and let all the loose, wild energy reign free than to reverse it. 

But I’d like to try. And I think that’s got to count for something, right?
