In the last couple of months, I've thought a lot about happiness and what I've wanted to make of my time. It's almost a given that I'm supposed to get good grades, win tournaments, constantly be productive, and stack up that fat fat resume.

I've always thought that once I achieved x, I'd be happy. Once I received this or this, I'd be fulfilled. I would be lying if I said that those didn't give me excitement-but just like anything else, that feeling was fleeting and I just began wanting more. Perhaps that's the goal in life. You savor each victory while it lasts and chase the next one down.

Or perhaps, it's the simple things that life is more so about. That feeling when you check off the last of the things on your to-do list, that new catchy song you just discovered on your Spotify, the almost eerily perfect rhythm of a couple of friends goofing off. Cracking jokes is one of the only things in life that's universally uncontestedly good - everyone benefits.

I'm still not sure exactly what makes me happy, and I suppose this entry really lacks any ending note. But that's okay, since I have the rest of my life to find a conclusion.
