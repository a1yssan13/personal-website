one of my favorite parts of penn is locust walk, which is our main campus street, lovingly sheltered under two parallel rows of towering birch. most nights, i walk through locust as i head back frrom the library, when the bustle of daytime crowds disappear and the path is only illuminated by the hazy glow of streetlights. i find that it becomes much easier to let my mind freely wander unconstrained in those late hours. for instance, i'll consider that maybe the allure of night skies is connected to color theory; it's beautiful because the dusky, soft indigo expanse is a perfect juxtaposition to the sharp, glittery yellows of the stars. or, as i step through a clearing to see the distant high rises, I'll find a small sort of delight in entertaining the unknown lives of strangers - what goes on behind the lantern windows? what does the interior design look like? who are the kinds of people living there, and what are their lives like?

walking back at night feels... peaceful. by midnight, the streets are calm as the fierce tides of the world temporarily subside away into the darkness. in-between steps, i breathe in the crisp coolness of the air, feeling the wind biting through my thin t-shirt, listening to its sound effects through the rustling of the leaves. through some mechanism i do not understand, those brief 10-minute walks somehow can squeeze and drain all of the messiness and unease the day has collected, and by the time i'm in front of my dorm, i'm only left with a simple appreciation of everything wonderful the world can be.

speaking of nice scenery appreciation, a couple weeks ago i visited new york, and at some point we clambered to the rooftop of an undinky, china-town building, where i saw the entirety of a 360 degree skyline of the city. ive realized a thought-pattern always occurs whenever i find myself in high up birds-eye views: first, i'll feel like my problems are unimportant & the world is large and filled with many, many people with equally unimportant problems, and then i'll be awed by how the anthropocene is incredibly mind-boggling & tall infrastructure is really awesome. and then i'll pretend like i'm some sort of cool, ascended higher-livel being who has the perspective to see all the tiny people hurrying along streets at millimeter steps, all measurable by a pinkie fingernail from up here. but as i began considering all of this, it occurred to me that there could very well be a stranger on the opposite side in that exact instant. a stranger who was standing on the rooftop in the tiny faint buildings on the _other side of the city_, and that I was just an inperceptable dot in the mass of distant skyscrapers and little people that _they saw_. so unbeknownst to either of us, we simply both peered strraight through one another, as if we were at the centermost point on top of the world, when in reality each of us were only a single pixel from the other's worldview .

for the last few months, I’ve fallen into the trap in romanticizing on what little I can recall of (the early 2010’s) past. which frankly, it’s been so long ago that I no longer remember 10-year-old Alyssa as a “me” as much as an unfamiliar  “her” to construct in my head. its weird to think of when this exactly happened - does anyone really feel fully aware saying goodbye their childhood? i know I didn’t; it was only this June when I got into the driver’s seat, that it hit me like a incoming wreck: how the hell could i drive, and was i actually already 18? the last half decade felt like i woke up from a trance - what precise moment was it when my unabashed reverie for Junie b Jones and Firefly hunts was replaced by obsessive self-doubt and phone-scrolling insomnia? it’s only much later when I decided to look behind me with clear eyes, and by then it's already been a couple years.

i’m bringing this up because in a similar way, it seems like i’m being whisked away to enter some realm of capital-A Adulthood --- except this time around, im acutely aware of it all happening. i notice a lot of the small things: unironically talking about the weather, boarding my first train/flight alone, worrying about when i need to get groceries or take out the trash, or the other thousand monotonous & mundane adulty things i never imagined id do. but i guess what really catches me off guard is that i feel so lost all the damn time. it seems that this is a vast world of chaos and absurdity with no real encapsulation of right or wrongs. people advise me to seek for advice, but there's a thousand voices of reason thrown at me, and then a thousand contradictory recommendations, and then more rebuttals to those contradictory arguments, and even more clauses and exceptions to think about. it feels unfair and i’d wish I had mental preparation to know that this is what its like; i'm quite unready to let go of the comforting smallness of the easy right and wrongs of my former world just yet. 

more than anything, i feel like growing older is a continuous battle of embracing solitude. during quarantine, I went an entire year in self-isolation without much complaint, and now that I’m constantly surrounded by other people, I’ve felt the most isolated I’ve ever been (i still need to think more closely about why). regardless, here’s a hidden truth I’ve come to realize about loneliness: it’s not instant or apparent, but it creeps up and settles in quietly, like snowflakes drifting from the Decembery wintery abyss of a sky. by the time you look up, you’re already blanketed six feet deep. 

but what else can you do, but suck it up and trudge on anyway? there’s still psets to be completed, meetings to be attended to, quizzes to be taken. the things scheduled in my calendar do not leave me space to wallow in self-irritation. besides, in a twisted sort of way, i kind of find satisfaction in the deep-rooted ache of being alone - every subsequent day means i get a little stronger, a little more untethered & accustomed to the feeling of independence.

so ive settled for the fact thaat all you can really do is to try harder - meeting new people, caring for the ones you love, innovating and discoring ways to fill the void. for todaay, it’s good enough to believe in a world where the sun will sift through the gloom one day & you’ll run. faster and faster and faster to chase down the golden rays, willing the light to burn & melt every last bit of frost that remains.
