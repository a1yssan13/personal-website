College application season has really gotten me in an awful mood- I've been thinking a lot about what I'd like to do with my life and what I even mean to the context of the world. It's not helping that we're reading Kafka in AP Literature right now. Metamorphosis, the book we're analyzing, lacks a sort ending insight that feels defining for the essence of any typical story. I could be wrong- I skimmed the story and probably just missing the point. But the man just dies. So, I finish the story and stare at the last page for a couple of minutes, wishing desperately for a more satisfying ending or some overused-but-encompassing moral to wrap things up. Mostly so I just could nod, feel like an intellectual, and forget whatever lesson I just learned right after. And I guess that's the "absurdity" that existentialists refer to: we probably don't really have conclusions or grand meanings to our stories- death is just as insignificant as us.

In sophomore year, I had regular bouts of existential crisises that made me terrified of going to sleep every night. Every night, I'd squeeze my eyes shut and try to wrap my ahead around the inevitable doomsday where I suddenly cease to exist; that every feeling, thought, emotion that makes me the consciousness that I am at this very second is all completely wiped into oblivion. It is not just a temporary thing either- it is forever. Forever. That's is a scary word to say by itself, because who the fuck even knows what forever even means. I know they say that you will just be what you were before you were born, and of course that doesn't scare you. But I can't have ever experienced that either, because I was literally just not at the time (I apologize for the weird wording, but "not" is really the best way to describe it). I'd try to convince myself that I ( as in my thoughts, consciousness) am only a physical consequence of some series of particles colliding and forming chemical reactions against each other through a coordinated series. That didn't fare well, because you can never really just embrace feeling slightly more complex object like a rock. People who are like "wow I've accepted it" feel like bullshitters. What does accepting it even mean? You just don't bother to think about it anymore. At the same time I think: In a mere 100 years or 1000 years or maybe 10,000 years (a blink in the universe's time) absolutely none of this matters. So why am I trying to care? Nevertheless, I still care about the nonsensical rules of societal expectations; I'd still dutifully go back to my homework to start setting up differential equations. I'd still listen to the endless droning on of teachers I didn't want to tolerate. I'd still feel socially awkward and anxious when people approached me. Frankly, it's hard to pinpoint the reason. Habit? Expectation? I think it's mostly because it's a path of least resistance- I'm assured that conformity is met with approval, of general happiness, at least of others at me. And that makes navigating this chaotic world a little more pleasant (?).

But I digress. I didn't log on into this in order to rant about my existential crises- I learned that thinking about yourself can only make myself more down and discomforted and panicked. It only connects a little because I've been thinking lately about the concept of loneliness.

Nathaniel Hawthorne once wrote "We live as we dream-alone."

It sounds kind of dumb when you first listen to it. Or maybe it reads like something straight out of r/im14andimdeep. But I distinctively remember in the classrooms of Chemistry Honors I had this super angsty revelation (as you'd expect an emo teen might). That we are lonely not because our emotions or situations are novel (who are we kidding, there are 7 billion people on this planet). It's because no one else occupies this specific body, this perspective and feelings, this memory, this very weird ability to choose what happens for this person. Empathy, obviously exists, but it's all speculative at best. You can't \*really\* know anything about someone else, you can only assure them you might've at some point felt similarly. But it's only a bandaid. Language is even more terrifying-it's insane how delusional we are about how we can communicate so much using language. If only language could truly fully communicate pain, or anger, or sadness. Even the best prose delivers only a faint mirage of the real experiences. Perhaps genuine writing or poetry delivers a snapshot at some point, but it's very limited nonetheless.

Anyway, speaking of loneliness (God I'll never get to the point): I find myself questioning why I'm so often wish for another person's presence at all. The thing about my crushes, I've noticed, is that I don't want someone just to hug or comfort or hold hands with. Renee thinks I could be aromantic but I certainly don't think so. I like people. Mostly, I just really like someone to have interesting and thoughtful conversations with. I have all these stupid crises and sometimes I'd like to talk about them, but apparently that's just not the norm to spew your deliberations or some nonsense to your friends and really receive an equally earnest response. But wow, imagine having a person in your life you're so comfortable with that you can just vocalize anything you want to, earnestly. Maybe this just means I should major in Philosophy in college (although my thoughts are wayyy too simple to even classify as Philosophy, but I think it's leaning in that direction at least), but I think 1. I'm not smart enough to. 2. I'd definitely give my parents a heart attack 3. Condemning myself to ponder these big questions is honestly frightening and I don't want to be forced to do it all the time.

But even that confuses me: What am I looking for? Am I looking out for other opinions on these topics, because there are countless textbooks and literary veins of ideas discussing the things I like to think about, I can just read them right now. Am I trying to hold a conversation? Because the amount of train of thoughts in my head already contradict and conflict with each other for endless spews of conversation. Am I just looking for the comfortable idea that someone else is also just as conflicted? Because if it's the latter, why does it even inherently bring me comfort how other people feel and if they feel similarly to me? Like, it's not like that solves any of the stupid questions or thoughts I have.

Those are my musings now. Yeah.
