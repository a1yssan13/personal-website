Recently I've thought about language a lot and how and why it functions in the context of our daily lives. According to the official definition given by Google, language is "the principal method of human communication, consisting of words used in a structured and conventional way and conveyed by speech, writing, or gesture". Although, John Green puts it much better (at least, in my opinion), that all that language is is to make my thoughts transparent to you.

Anyway, if you think about it intuitively, we generally study and emphasize language in order to convey 'me' and accept 'you', like radio signal waves who beep out different wavelengths to one another-similar in some ways and different in others. I guess I'd initially didn't have to think twice to believe that we are the all-mighty dictator and shaper of language; the words we say are a consequence of our sole experiences. Like, we are the author of the unique experiences that are prescribed to us at birth, which no-one can truly share without the aid of our choices and combination of words. Words and consonants are pawns that I wielded. They shared the temperature I felt and the scenery I see into squiggly shapes into a slur of syllables and assortment of sounds, a slave to my choices and the paper of the story I write. 

But, I'd been thinking about this for a while. In a more subtle but powerful way, language is really like, the dictator of us and our experiences, vastly more than the other way around. Like, I'm not sure if that makes sense, but my entire consciousness is shaped around and infiltrated by the way that words exist, and I have very little control over any of it, let alone the words I choose.

Here’s something interesting I once learned. In ancient history, [the color blue didn’t exist](https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-didn-t-see-the-colour-blue-until-modern-times-evidence-science) for the Greeks, or at least, there is like no historical record of it. For example, in Homer, the color of the sea was often described as “dark wine”, and there was little actual color references (like, at all) for most things besides “bright” and ‘dark”. In fact, this weird phenomenon wasn’t just seen in ancient Greece, but in all types of ancient civilizations, like blue wasn't found in Chinese or Arabian or Hebrew texts either. And there's the super weird part. And in a more modern (?) experiment, a young girl who never came across the word “blue” was asked to describe the sky, and she she ultimately decided on “white” after much deliberation.

It isn’t as if the human body suddenly evolved to see new spectrums of light in different ways-the light fractured and folded into their retinas the same way as we perceive light now. Though, in those times, people probably experienced “blue”, but never translated that connected imagery into words. I'd imagine the idea of the color blue was so insignificant, that it wasn't even worthy of being termed into a word or even noticed for a long time until one day, some stranger centuries later pointed out the notion and beauty of the unique shade and I guess (?) people started agreeing with them. I don't know why I find all this so hard to believe. Partially, it's probably considering how many instagram story posts all glorify how the sky is so magnificent/beautiful, that it's hard to think that the people long ago didn't put a word to the way the sky looked-especially because I'd imagine they would've appreciated the very same beauty we do.

So when I was really young I was told that dogs have like, dichromatic vision (so they can see very limited color ranges) and ever since, I felt a little remorseful that there were many things that I would never know because of the limited capacity of human senses. I guess, thinking about all this, I wonder how many things worth noticing we don't notice only because we don't actually _think_ about it. Especially thing we don't have words for it.

When I was super young, probably like 5 years old, and we were first learning about the five senses, my teacher explained the traditional Chinese saying that there are four basic tastes: 酸，甜，苦，辣. These four words translates to sour, sweet, bitter, spicy. It's like an idiom (?) or saying, because I remember I played games where each finger would be a taste and I would go down my arm reciting them. I guess they're somewhat universally accepted, which is why I literally thought they were the only tastes that existed, but then I realized there are all these different tastes that are common but never really acknowledged, like ["fat" and "umami"](https://www.livescience.com/17684-sixth-basic-taste.html), which are very weird-sounding but make a lot of sense. I just- don't notice them or even think about them much- because they're not in my vocabulary.

There’s this quote in Lady Bird that’s always stuck out to me that “love is attention”. I'm not sure who said this, but there's another quote I distinctly recall, which is that "beauty is only a matter of attention". Or on that matter, most things are a matter of attention.

Maybe, this is why for reasons I can't understand, that my friend describes the way that physics equations form as “beautiful”. My brother, when he writes code, describes the formatted code as so great and satisfying. It's just all a matter of attention.

Have you ever looked at something that you deemed aesthetic and wondered if it was inherently that pretty to an ignorant eye, or if you were conditioned to believe so after consuming so many films and books reaffirming it? Like, are starry nights or moons beautiful, or are they so because I know for a fact they're supposed to be, so as a result, I pay extra attention and because of that, it becomes beautiful? And attention is not just limited "beauty", but I notice myself stopping to appreciate many "stereotypically" wonderful moments. Like, in the midst of gazing at fireworks with my friends at an amusement park, I'll stop and wonder if this is a moment I'll remember for a while time _because it feels like something straight off a movie_ and try to capture how it feels. Or, when it's like a bonfire night, I'll try to inhale as much s'more scents as possible and encapsulate the view of a flame flickering and illuminating the faces of those around me, because I _know_ this is what society deems a 'memorable' moment.

I take a walk down my street. It’s approaching Fall, and the scenic street is full of trees in hues of pumpkin and maroon and yellow. It’s 5 pm, around dusk, and the warm glow of the streetlights softly ignite the gently falling leaflets. And I stop, because I instinctively can tell I’m stepping into a painting. I’m not sure why the scene is so picturesque—it might be a faint image of something I've imagined in a coming-of-age film. And suddenly, the scene is much more beautiful than it was just momentarily before. It’s only me and the familiar street and I can’t stop wondering if this is what it means when they say that it’s breathtakingly beautiful. 

I used to play this game of trying to test what makes the moments I can remember the moments I remember. When I'm thinking about what I was like when I was like 10 years ago, I can only recall a few specific "screenshotted" memories in detail, but nothing in a continuum (like how a story progresses). Like, I can remember this one time my dad took me hiking and the specific moment I jumped over a rock, or this one morning my mom was dressing me with this pink sweater, nothing much more resurfaces to mind. What made those mundane moments special? And do I really have any control over "saving" which moments I'll recall in the far future? Of course, big moments in your life are surely memorable, but what _mundane_ moments will you remember?

I guess I've tested my theory out in like fourth grade. I remember I was on a field trip to a theatre, and I was leaning against the window of a seat looking out at the parking lot. I still vividly remember the parking lot lines being shaped in a v outwards, because I was thinking about all this, and I wanted to commit to remembering this dumb, insignificant moment to test it all out, test out if I had control over the memories. I guess I still remember it, so we do have much control over what we remember.

What exactly dictates what things you pay attention to, especially when you're not "meta-ing" to commit these things to memory? Archetypes and words are created as a result of many, many years by many, many people. In a way, language is the collective human project that ties us together, because I guess it evolves and modifies according to our usage and what we all agree with. It's because some dude probably called like Jeff a millenium ago suddenly coined the term "fall _in_ love" and felt like it was a more powerful way to describe the specific feeling, and then maybe hundreds of thousands of people agreed. And so we have very specific images and feelings associated with that phrase, and now we stop and pay closer attention to when we think it'll peak around the corner.

I honestly don't know if anything I said at all makes any bit of sense to anyone whose not me. And that's probably okay, because this is all irrelevant, besides the point that it's kind of cool that language shapes our experiences. And we have choices over what is beautiful, and even though language tells us often times what is, we can still make those choices ourselves, right?

So I walk down the streets, sunlight scattering in golden rays through the leaves. Maybe there’s nothing about that scene that makes it intrinsically beautiful-only that I’ve stopped to notice it.
