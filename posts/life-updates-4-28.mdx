I'm writing again today because I'm feeling a little pent up- apparently blogging seems to be my new reliable coping mechanism during the time of night right before bedtime when I'm weirdly hyperaware of like, everything (?). So of course my solution is to find something to do to utterly exhaust every single one of my brain cells so they're beyond the point of...wandering about aimlessly into uncharted territories. So, low effort low quality post here again, but i'm working on compiling my thoughts about some stuff so that should be up sometime soon, or not if i procrastinate, who knows :)

- so I like regular k-pop but in the past couple of months I've been into watching/listening to a series where the singers go busking with a crowd of like everyday folk (beginagainkorea, for ex: [lee hi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq-A2RJC7fg&ab_channel=Beginagain%EB%B9%84%EA%B8%B4%EC%96%B4%EA%B2%8C%EC%9D%B8), [all for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEgvCBcfFLI&ab_channel=Beginagain%EB%B9%84%EA%B8%B4%EC%96%B4%EA%B2%8C%EC%9D%B8), [for lovers who hesitate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENj1IM3FrGg&ab_channel=Beginagain%EB%B9%84%EA%B8%B4%EC%96%B4%EA%B2%8C%EC%9D%B8).) and it's SO CUTE. I wish I could sing nicely because the dream is to run away to a small european town and everyday busk on a cute foreign street with friendly shops all the way till nightfall, making perfectly imperfect music for strangers who pause because your voice made their lives a little more colorful that day. that's the dream - so maybe in another life?
- in reference to that like entire spiel about selling out I wrote a couple days ago - within the last few days I found this really cool [website](//80000hours.org/) which is exactly what I've been looking for for a while. I haven't, like, really explored every single page here but it definitely brings me a lot of reassurance that 1. this exists for me to read into in the near and long term future 2. my committed majors are actually pretty good choices with a wide range of applications which makes me feel a lot better about my decision (i'd be going in the direction compatible with most of the jobs that the website mentions should I ultimately decide to pursue similar veins of careers in the future).
- I'm officially on a diet now which is awful and horrendous and now I am deprived of everything that brings me joy, but I realized that I have gained way TOO MUCH weight during quarantine. I usually wouldn't worry about stuff like this too much but um I Live In A Society Driven By Men Of Power And Unrealistic Beauty Standards But Conformity Gives You Many Many MANY Perks and no one can fucking deny that. on that note I don't... really know how to diet sustainably or actually convince myself to stave off food so if anyone has any tips that would be awesome.
- OH another update, I'm not sure why I am engaging in this unacceptable behavior, because I swore off debate in college PROFUSELY for the longest time (since god knows I don't need that type of stress in my life again). but when the Penn Debate Society introduction meeting post appeared a total of THREE times in my Facebook feed, I somehow found myself as a participant in that cursed zoom meeting because: idk, _why not?_
- Why do I do this to myself?
- Why?
- WHY
- hmmm 1. The idea of traveling to a ton of places and cities for free sounds really great to be honest, and uh if I'm paying this spicy tuition I want to exhaust penn of their funding if possible 2. i hate to admit it but I really like debaters and I have a feeling I could make really nice friends3. goddammit debate is kind of fun and idk? tryouts make me like maybe i should. Despite all of this, I still don't think I will join (?) although I would really like to talk to someone that actually does APDA because I'm thoroughly confused how the heck it even works. And also is college debate worth?? if anyone actually know someone who does do it/or does it themselves please hit me up.
- So I've met like a lot of people online over the last week — partially through Instagram, mostly through this functionally-Tinder-for-making-friends app for college kids called Berri. In this short time period of experimentation, I have realized that 1. I cannot speak to people online for the life of me, no matter how much I try, I just... get bored, so I have resorted to asking people really random questions like what's your favorite animal — and they have proceeded to rnr me : D 2. For every, 15 people I talk to, I stumble upon that one person that makes me feel actually excited to actually read their replies and somehow we can have a conversation doesn't completely emotionally exhaust me. so maybe this is the sliver of motivation i'm clinging to, just swiping and swiping in vain hopes that that One Person appears once again. emphasis on vain here. 3. i don't know what's wrong with my brain, but now I understand fully the appeal of ghosting and it is a BAD BAD habit. The real question here is: Why is it... so easy to want to talk to other people but so much more difficult to respond to those SAME "group" of other people??? It feels very selfish but I can't shake off my inability to just want to ignore texts that take me more than 15 seconds to think of a not terrible response because usually I give up by then.
- I miss human beings. and i don't mean just seeing people socially distanced apart (though I also do miss seeing friends, yes), but I more or less hear a hollow echo reminiscent of the loud white noise of cafes or screams and shrieks in dirty hallways or the soft chatter in theatres before the movie begins. I want to share swathes of space with strangers who are not incessantly paranoid of each other's spittle or cooties or germs, but instead that very space is filled with carelessness and messiness, and just... i don't know, humanness? It feels like the world has been devoid of that for a while at least. And I think I miss that.

Sometimes, there are a series of days or even weeks when it feels like the engine is slowly down, and you're running out of fuel, and everything is so heavy and blurry and it's impossible to comprehend how you can possibly give a shit about anything in this stupid ass world. And in those slumps it's hard to even move my leg to the gas pedal let alone press it down to accelerate back up, and then these days are...simultaneously so easy and so difficult to trudge through, the days when you lost your zest for life and are desperately trying to get it back.

Someone told me they liked my blog a couple of days ago, and that made me really happy! I realize I feel pretty grateful that I do have a place to write things and make content - it feels good to have an avenue of producing stuff that functionally acts like a rope tethering me to keep myself moving, something that is still constant and ongoing regardless of the wavering levels of motivation I have from my day to day, week to week.
