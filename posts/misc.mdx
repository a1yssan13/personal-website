I haven't written anything in a while and it's because I haven't had anything super interesting to write about? but Wang told me to write something so instead this is mostly a collection of pretty vague and useless thoughts that I've had in the past couple of weeks in no particular order.

## Hedonic Treadmill

So the traditional explanation of the hedonic treadmill is that when your context and environment changes (when fortunate or misfortunate things occur to you) that changes your happiness level in the short term, but everything goes back to a certain level of happiness regardless- it's like you're a hamster on a treadmill constantly peddling and peddling on a never ending cycle.

The problem is that it forgets to add that yes, your context definitely decides a certain portion of your happiness in the short term, but your habits and daily attitudes are also equally if not more important towards dictating that "set bar"?

When I say habits and attitudes, this includes things I found to work like exercise, being productive, keeping your room clean, being a generally nice person - because like all of these raise your set level of happiness arguably more than a lot of environmental or contextual changes. I always assume wrongfully that I am actively chasing down long-run goals for the sake of long term happiness (which is true, but) also, feeling productive everyday is a necessity of short-term fulfillment and happiness. Maybe it's like a manifestation of [Sisyphus](https://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/sisyphus/summary/)' boulder to just constantly want to do work to be content?

But also the hedonic treadmill really is just a more complex way of writing the formula of:

`[happiness = reality - expectations]`

where your expectations adjust depending on your reality. I was wondering if it is possible to artificially force yourself lower your expectations, but that's also a form of feeble brainwashing to believe something else and refusing to acknowledge your inner expectation - you shouldn't use a reason to _want to_ believe something to actually believe something. But, luckily enough, our cognitive biases also tend make us super overblown [optimists](https://awario.com/blog/optimism-why-your-predictions-are-too-good-to-be-true/#:~:text=The%20absolute%20majority%20of%20us,predicting%20events%20for%20other%20people.) and that is a solid basis to convince ourselves to expect less, since we just normally expect way too much anyway and are often sorely disappointed. The other pro to consider is that through conditioning your brain for the worst outcome, it creates a sense of security to know you are in full preparation of the situation regardless of what happens.

When I talk about pessimism I don't mean feeling pessimistic about how happy you will be? (like feeling disillusioned with your ability to be happy in the future) but instead feeling pessimistic about the out-of-control circumstances you face but conditioning yourself to be okay/happy with that as well.

The counterargument is that well, optimism is good for happiness & motivates us to do work. I'd argue that optimism in the present tense is probably a good thing (gratitude journals, the glass is half-full right now) and pessimism for the future better. As for better fuel to do work, I just need to experiment with ways to strike a balance of fewer expectations and working hard, which is certainly not impossible to do, especially if I already tend to do work for short-term fulfillment rather than long term expectations.

I haven't been doing any of this that much (adjusting my perception of the future) but I am trying to do so and will give an update in a couple of months if I keep up with it.

The other thing I was thinking of is that it seems objectively worse to be a biological female than a male just based on the fact that 1/4 of our lives are bound to be unhappy because I feel grumpy and awful on my period, which is SO UNFAIR if you consider that because we are just doomed to misery. Like, why is it that for females those 1/4th of our lifespans are just FUCKED?

Additionally, I've been pretty intrigued by research & graphs on happiness recently so I will insert some here. I think I am pretty skeptical of most happiness science because I don't see how you can genuinely measure it accurately? But it's cool to read about anyway.

https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how\_much\_of\_your\_happiness\_is\_under\_your\_control

I don't know how accurate this is or how to interpret this, because there are a lot of interaction terms here (your genetics effects how likely you are to work, your propensity to make things happen also changes your situation). In another study mentioned in the [article](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_much_of_your_happiness_is_under_your_control), I think they found that genetics may account for 80% of your happiness. This doesn't seem very reassuring but I guess it's still interesting to consider nonetheless & a reminder to that intentional activity still takes a large stake of the pie.

This is a really fascinating graph to see because it seems to be the case that you on average maximize happiness after hitting six figures but not much more after. It also seems interesting that this trend is universal across most countries. I'm not sure what the actual implications of this is, because if someone is set on being rich, being told that they won't be much happier doesn't seem like it will be an effective deterrent, but still overall the methodology actually looks pretty reasonable? and it seems to somewhat disagree with the hedonic cycle where its more like a hedonic hill with actual slopes to climb.

This is just a very funny graph that I don't really think has actual scientific backing but um, who knows! Seems kinda accurate. It reminds me of Flowers for Algernon.

## Rationality & Politics

I've been spending more time reading on rationality (mostly posts from Scott Alexander & LW) which is really fascinating. I think I will probably try to apply some of these tools and thought-concepts into my worldview unless given a good reason not to. So far the conflicting criticisms haven't been very convincing, but I'm sure there must be better criticism of the rationality community out there I haven't encountered yet.

The biggest takeaway/summarization here is that we tend to conflate what we believe and what we want to believe way too heavily both intentionally and subconsciously, whether this is as cliche as religious beliefs or just typical niche beliefs tied to ideas we invest in (invest as in invest our time, our energy, our ego & image , idk). Instances of this include: it is really hard to change your mind after you first make a decision, conforming mindlessly to beliefs around you, conjuring dumb explanations of stuff because you want to (ie karma). Ofc there are a lot of specifics I'm omitting here but the general idea here is that we are tragically and irreparably biased.

I'd like to think that I believe in things I actually think are true, but in retrospect I spend a lot of time convincing myself of things I'd want to believe in instead? The most obvious of which is sometimes I like to try to justify the best I can that afterlives exist, but other less grotesque examples include convincing myself of different self-perceptions or my reasoning for otherwise questionable actions (which I know deep down are not the real reasons I do xyz) or even beliefs about other people's actions. Once you want to believe in something now you exclusively collect evidence supporting that fact and omit the search counter-evidence. Self-deception reminds me of that chinese proverb 掩耳盗铃 (a thief covers his own ears when stealing a bell LOL). I guess the important thing to remember is that whatever is real deal is, you are already living in it and dealing with its consequences? Modifying the map doesn't change the territory.

Oh! One particular train of thought that I quite like is that the rationality community really strikes down about the "in-group" "out-group" phenomenon. Once you belong to a specific "group" (religiously, political parties, culturally, even like, HS cliques?) it's excessively easy to face a "us" vs "them" mindset. You believe everyone else is stupid or irrational when in reality every single group thinks this way about their respective outgroups. This is obviously very intuitive but it's pretty prevalent everywhere ranging from political parties to cults to historical wars/genocides or whatever else.

\[okay content warning: the next paragraph goes into politics which uh the vast majority of ppl get angry about so… \]

Maybe this is just an excuse to insert this hot take here but I am sometimes a little frustrated when people ask for my political preferences and then act like if I am not wholly aligned with Democrats as if this itself is a betrayal of basic humanity and morality. I don't see this as very productive at all - if you'd asked me what I thought about a UBI or universal healthcare or idk progressive taxation aka very specific policies I'd be very willing to have an interesting conversation about the utilitarian consequences of it, but why must I join forces with a political army encompassing so many issues I'm not even wholly educated about and form a strong stance for? I guess for one, politics just doesn't interest me very much, but moreover, I feel like it's a lot more reasonable to talk about the actual issues before you go into the label of what group you are.

Sometimes it feels like everything's a war and you just gotta join a side or be thrown to the wolves, and once you join a side who tf cares if your stance is really the objectively best one rather than a stance to blindingly defend? And most of the time everyone treats the other side as absolute morons BUT people's brains are like, not that different in the grand scheme of thing. I generally think there is a lot of context and understandable "why" for both sides of most contested issues?? So why do people just try to belittle the other side as much as possible - if you believe they are dumb does calling them fucking idiots make the situation any better?

Political parties has always been a way to ostracize any of the outgroup WHICH is so widespread in our current climate, where 95% of exchanges consist of hurling derogatory remarks and/or inserting self-righteous rhetoric (more blatantly in some exchanges, more kindly phrased in others) with very little direct engagement. The overall consequence is that opposing sides just hate each other more, which is frustrating because I would say that I lean pretty far left on a lot of issues, but I still feel so on edge talking to most left-identifying people about them. People tend to offer more meaningless insults about opposing views than helpful warrants. Like, imagine if you were trying to ask for math help from a kid in your class and the kid was just ruthlessly belittling all the kids who used the dumbass substitution method instead of the superior factoring method, it'd be pretty intimating to ask for suggestions about any method of solution to them on another math problem even if you agreed previously that the substitution method isn't the most efficient?

Okay I realize the hypocrisy here that I understand why people generally like to do this (the ingroup outgroup classification) and I do this as well (a lot) so the solution here is to just for everyone to be a little more cognizant to fight our inherent biases?

^oh, the above was just a poorly summarized version of this article so if anyone is actually interested, here it [is](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). (This is a much, much better worded article than anything I ranted LOL)

## Selling Out

So I think in high school there is this very binary view on what selling out is, which is essentially if you work for Big Tech, finance (quants/investing banking/consulting), or in general high-paying jobs, you are "selling out" your talent and ability for money. Most people (especially immigrant parents who emphasize financial stability) are pretty happy about this outcome, but I think a lot of high school students I've encountered who feel an obligation to do good for society seem to be really on edge about potentially selling out.

The general stereotype for these people is that sell out = bad. Not sell out = good. It is unclear exactly what you would be doing that is good if you do NOT sell out, but this is besides the point, because if you're smart and capable enough of selling out and you choose not to, it seems like you are probably doing something somewhat worthwhile.

Recently I asked an M&T student about this idea of selling out and how the actual labor market works, and it seems to be the case that most companies are not black and white and a lot of individual teams within large companies have a general culture of doing good. Obviously it is possible that they were just trying to justify to themselves their decision to work in big tech? but I think it is more likely that high schoolers just perpetuate this idea that all big corporations are inherently evil, which, when you examine them in detail they are nuanced and complex like most issues are when you look close up.

The stigma associated with "selling out" doesn't take into account the "effective altruism" pathway, which is that you should maximize your income regardless of what you do and then donate all unnecessary income towards Good Organizations (https://www.givewell.org/) to decrease world suck. I remember talking to this guy a couple of months back and he was like "My leftist organizing unfortunately requires money in this capitalist machine" and I thought that remark was very funny esp since i think he ran a lot of cap ks.

The criticism of effective altruism I've read is that when you deplete your willpower to do good through things like donations, you lack the motive to push for more vast and structural changes through political means that actually reforms the exploitative dynamic of developed vs developing countries. This is fair, but I can't imagine what I could possibly do reasonably otherwise that will create these changes, but also that risk/probability calculus of such an endeavor succeeding wares me off because it requires like VAST collective action. Additionally, I think that just helping these Good Organizations has definite spillover effects & maybe change from the ground-up is also a good way to help rather than from the top-down.

Of course, the most difficult part of this entire endeavor is that it seems to be really hard to actually hold yourself accountable to really donate all your money? Or at least beyond the bare minimum & keep a large portion for yourself, or make up some justification that I should just donate everything at the end of my life after I invest & maybe multiply my assets (which is apparently not good because these Good Organizations also have funds that they can invest with as well).

At the end of the day what I think I am most swayed by is that selling out seems to correlate to a position of higher power and esteem in society regardless of your precise occupation, so eventually if I do want to do something good or even if do not, I have more means and freedom to do it.

And I am trying to figure out the Truth without conflating what I want to believe in the process. What I want to believe is I will choose an occupation that I love to do and also maximizes my own wellbeing. Not to say these are antithetical at all to doing a societally-beneficial job, but they are definitely not the same thing, so I'm trying my best not to gaslight myself (but I probably am to some extent). This post is beginning to read like me trying to justify that I am selling-out with good reasons where maybe my deep down motives are very different and selfish? AHHH I don't know man.

^^Anyway, I'm still super duper confused about general occupation things so if anyone is very enlightened I'd appreciate some advice :)

## Conclusion

Okay, so this post ended up being a lot longer than I expected. Idk if anyone actually bothered to read this far but kudos I guess.
