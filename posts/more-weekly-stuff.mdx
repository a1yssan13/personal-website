- binge read HPMOR fanfic like literally 3 days day in day out and this has to be one of my favorite books now. there's so many interesting ideas + i felt so good reading it because usually when i read im super annoyed at the characters for certain portrayls or behaviors that are just dumb, but harry here is just so smart and rational and it honestly had a lot of really good lessons i will read more on in the future
- watched "your name engraved herein", which is a film exploring the relationship of a lgbtq couple in taiwan, which is set in a catholic school after the lifting of martial law. i quite liked this film because i feel like there's very little asian queer representation at all. also i enjoy watching chinese films because i can practice my language comprehension + in general i found this a pretty good watch - i also think the actors did a really good job like reactions/expressions on point!
- watched "ferris bueller's day off" which is like really funny but also gave me second hand anxiety so i couldn't finish it. i don't know if im just being a wuss but it makes me so squirmish to watch kids being dumbasses doing things that are "cool" but obviously are just unnecessarily and being complete assholesly things to do to adults who are already having a shitty life. this is all purely for their own selfishness with like zero disregard to how it impacts other ppl - like call me a prim prick but i feel so terrible for like all the adults in the film because like the kids manipulating them is still romanticized in some way??? whereas if they were not kids they'd be 100% attacked by everyone. full disclosure tho i stopped midway so maybe they learn a lesson at the end idk.
- went to hobby lobby + bought some paint supplies. i got some really cute small canvases that were on sale (! i am so asian) and it's great because i used to have only red/yellow/blue paints and mix all the other colors together myself because i was cheap but now i have turquoise/green/pink which is great because it's easier to be motivated to paint when you don't have to mix literally every single fucking color together for like minutes at a time. so i ended up finishing a painting i started - i will insert progress photos here!!!! i feel like it looks very warped and disproportional but um all my friends say it looks fine so i will take that as just me looking at the picture too much.

thoughts on wasting time: (preface: this is not to say that all of these are bad ways to spend your time, just my own personal thoughts of choosing what to do w my time) i was talking to renee about this but i feel like i have a spectrum of what i feel are tolerable ways of wasting time and classification of what is productive or not. things that i do that are productive ways of wasting time make me feel not shit about my day when i end my day, but things i do that are bad ways of wasting time make me feel pretty terrible about myself and make me not want to think about my day. for example, i feel like consuming anime or like movies, reading books, or hanging out with friends are pretty high on the productive wasting time spectrum. wheras things like simple/repetitive video games, binging youtube videos, or scrolling through social media is like very bad and guilt-inducing wasting time methods.

i think i can break down everything i do into consuming content & creating content. for example, all the above are consuming content, and how productive the content is seems to be based on 1. if it's applicable to something i might encounter in the future (a good test is to consider whether i will remember said content in like 2 weeks - so for instance i would remember most books or movies but not a youtube video) 2. how much time/resources it took to make the content (yt videos takes v little ppl's energy + time, movies/books take a lot of time + resources). the latter requirement is probably pretty indicative of how "quality" i perceive the content to be - if ppl put much of their brains + years of experience in the content, then i assume that it will probably be worthwhile to consume.

the flip side of consuming content is creating content, which is like blog posts, paintings, or doing work for school + other projects. i find these things to be in general always an elevated level in the productivity spectrum, altho i am not directly absorbing more information but i feel like i am doing somehting useful?? how productive i feel about these sorts of things kinds of directly link to how unique of a contribution i bring - for example, i feel like i waste all my time doing school work because it's not like anything i do actually matters, whereas if i produce content through making graphics for btl's website it feels much more fulfilling because i am creating a very unique and specific contribution. blog posts + art feel pretty productive because it is very "me" in the sense that it feels like a method of expression that feEls ProdUCtIVe i don't knowwww.

i'm not sure if this productivity spectrum is like elitist or problematic? i hope im not like devaluing important work or activities other ppl enjoy but i guess it's almost ingrained in my head that i have to be productive OR ELSE and now i just rank and perceive all entertainment activities as a form of productivity, even if it's subconsciously most of the time. this is not to say i feel productive all the time because uh anyone knows i am a lazy ass a lot but i guess i still have a guilt-complex built into me even as i waste weeks away.

oh, the other question here is that why do i seek a need to consume content all the time??? at first, i always just assumed it was like curiosity for new things int he world, but that is definitely not the case considering the types of content i like to consume is often times completely irrelevant to anything. otherwise, another explanation is that i will get bored otherwise, and this is not the case either?? because the definition of bored is just "having nothing to do" but why do we need something to do at all?? i think the reality is that if i don't consume content i will be left to my own devices and that the noise that your brain makes when you have nothing to occupy yourself with is terrifying in anything more than absolute necessary amounts.
