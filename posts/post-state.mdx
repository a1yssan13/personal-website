(written on the 14th? published later)

It’s 12:30 and you know how i said that one post about debate was going to be the last post about debate? yeah it seems that that’s not going to be the case. 

It’s 12:30 am and it’s the exact time of the night where i start flipping through snippets in my brain of all the stuff i _don't_ want to think about normally, and right now is when i decide i miss the long bus rides and the buckeyes quickstops to middle-of-nowhere-texas, late night whispers in cramped 2-bed hotel rooms, the click-clack of heels down grimy halls and everything else that i haven’t even wholly comprehended that I can never do again. 

today we debated our last round ever, and it was as unexciting and unspectacular as every other one we’ve had this year. i would not be thinking so hard about it had it not been our last round, but it is, and now i’m a little sad. we read a pretty cool argument, lost on a 2-1, and that is that. after all, it wasn't a bad last round by any means.

i heard as an underclassman that unless you win the NSDA tournament or smth, most debaters end on a loss, which i had always promised myself and romanticized that i would be a definitive outlier here because i was going out with a good happy ending. but now i clearly don't care anymore - whether i just hate debate or i'm too exhausted i'm can't pinpoint.

I have a sudden urge to go and write my paradigm on tabroom- because that’s the sort of thing that you’d do when you’re finally out of debate once and for all, when the finality all comes crashing down. It’s not like i couldn’t update my paradigm when i was still competing, it’s more of a symbolic thing like drinking on your 21th birthday even though it’s not like you couldn’t do it before. the funny thing about the whole ending/goodbye to debate is that i tell myself that it’s not “really” a goodbye because, you know, i’ll still judge and maybe even coach and be involved- but i know that deep down that that’s a lie and i probably won’t judge any more than two tournaments onwards. which is good, because by that point i will have truly and whollly deemed the activity an utter waste of energy. 

after we lost our last round cale sent angela and i a long message about how we’ve made an impact on debate in intangible ways beyond trophies, and i used to hear chetan talk about how he was most proud about the impact he’s made on west and the people, and other wholesome things like that. I can’t say angela and i didn’t try to do things to make pf better (altho we didn’t do that much), but after today i can’t say to myself honestly that we’ve truly done anything even remotely substantial at all. This is all especially compounded by this gut reaction that the state tournament i am attending as a senior is much, much less enjoyable in terms of norms (spamming argos and spreading, unfortunate judging, no female debaters past quarters) and general patterns of behavior than the state I attended as a freshman. if this is the fiasco that we're leaving behind, it seems very contradictory to think that we made any positive intangible impact?? i don't know.

today i went out today with angela and renee (we wore masks) to mald over state but it’s the first time in a very long time that i went out for a longer period of time and actually did things. Ofc we first spent our time being angry but then we kinda gave up because that was exhausting and pointless like anger usually is. 

It was quite windy in the park and we walked about aimlessly, speaking unusually loud because of the harsh ripping sounds of the wind and concluding that we were very lucky to have each other as friends/on the team. we played catan later, which is a very weird and boring game but apparently renee and angela enjoy it a lot for reasons I don’t understand. we also got ice cream at walmart and taco bell, which was nice because I haven’t had ice cream or taco bell in a hot minute and both were tasty :D. 

people can tell you cliches like, oh “how lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.” but that does not make the goodbye any less hard - if anything it makes it worse. it feels this way, at least a little bit right now as i’m laying on my bed and staring at the ceiling, wondering if ill ever feel this masochistically passionate about anything else ever again. 

“passion” is such a multidimensional world - you throw it around in college admissions essays but you never really admit that you are “passionate” about anything to your friends. i don’t know if i am passionate about debate in the sense that i believe debate is meaningful and important, but i am passionate in that i found a sense of purpose that i have clung onto with all shreds of dignity. With debate, you are always sure of a unalterable direction to head at any point in those four years of high school - you have a very clear and unquestionable goal. now i am a little disorientated with everything that is not debate around me and it’s all very confusing to realize that jobs and actual subjects like math or science and social statuses/circles exist.  

anyway i’m only feeling this way because it’s today, and i will not feel this way anymore by next week. It is too late and i will be sleeping. gn!
