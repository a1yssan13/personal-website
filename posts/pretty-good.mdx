“how’s life?”

a lot of people ask me this question as a greeting, and it’s actually one of the nicer ones to encounter - along with any of its sibling variations (how are you doing, how is it going? How is quarantine?). i instinctively say "pretty good" without _really_ thinking about the q, mostly to diffuse the polite introduction and move on, but anyway, i figured it’s healthy to ask myself this once in a while and answer considerately and honestly, right? 

in tenth grade our humanities teachers assigned us a CE article on “[niksen](https://outline.com/s48EVR)”, which is just wonky dutch jargon for “doing nothing” . As angsty teens usually approach these things we made fun of the term at the time and it became a meme, but now it occurred to me that i might've been coasting through senior year actually doing niksen (is that even how you use it properly in a sentence?). 

every day blurs together in subdued familiarity - i spend my afternoons drifting away along whichever stream of consciousness i choose, untethered by the roping mindfulness of constant deadlines or inescapable responsibilities. it’s really coincidental that my senior year and quarantine period cross paths now - like, it’s a natural breeding ground for being able to do, well you know, _nothing_. 

i find myself gazing out aimlessly at an aggravated squirrel burying its nut on a warm, sunlit afternoon. My desk faces a really large window, so all the rays of light is concentrated and spilled onto my scribbled sheets and pages covered in indecipherable doodles. One of my windows is always pushed up, and there’s a constant, rippling mellow breeze that’s cool and soft and pleasant. it’s really not any special type of day, just a typical comfortable and amicable one, which is a type i like! From my desk you can peer out to see the four adjacent panes of windows of my neighbor’s house, and on those panels you can see the rectangular reflection of the blue hues of the sky and clouds wading through lazily so i also like to watch those from time to time. 

Speaking of, it’s been especially nice weather these past two weeks. Texas doesn’t really have four seasons as much as two - winter and summer - and some short in-between weeks that are the transitory periods. It’s nice because it’s currently in between those valuable few weeks we have where it’s not quite the painful scalding of summer but also not the barren and frigid winter, aka everyone else in the world calls spring.

the small portable speaker on my desk is playing whatever piece queued randomly on the “classical piano” spotify playlist (it’s Mozart’s sonata no 15. In c major right now), and it's very pretty and reminds me of yellow straw hats and fresh bouquets and rain puddles, and the notes are all mixed in with an occasional bee buzz or the breeze brustling the bushes outside.

Anyway I’m reading Haruki murakami’s norweigan wood, which is like this more sexualized and depressing japanese version of catcher in the rye, but i paused because i stumbled upon this sentence in the scene after Toru decided to spend his day eating a sandwhich at a shop, reading and not doing much else. he says, “How many Sundays - how many hundreds of Sundays like this - lay ahead of me? ‘Quiet, peaceful, and lonely,’ I said aloud to myself”

i think that i forget that my days of quarantine and senior year are like this - quiet, peaceful, and lonely - and that every one of these days passes through without me noticing how lovely it is and how grateful i am. i realize i _should_ and i do; I feel grateful that today is a day i can live just perusing through the pages of whatever interesting novel i please. That today, i can pull out a paint box to work on whatever new art project i choose, that i can pick to live in my head all afternoon or i can even decide to do nothing at all and admire the even paint coating on my walls. i like these days, undisturbed by neither anything extraordinarily good or bad, that all events i might encounter fall neatly in place between the predictable shelves of the day-to-day ordinary.  

So how many days of these lazy, sunny afternoons do i have left ahead of me, days when i can forget everything else in the world because there’s nothing, absolutely nothing imperative I have to care to remember?     

a hundred? fifty-three? a thousand-three hundred-and four? two thousand? i don't know - i doubt anyone can really ever know themselves.   

Before covid ever started, maybe at one point i imagined that my senior year would be full of trips across town, of boba shops and board games, of six flags sprees- and maybe in a parallel universe that could’ve been the case? and undoubtedly i’m going to be a little regretful from time to time that that is not the senior year i end up experiencing - but i am glad nonetheless i am spending it this mundane but happy way. If i could time loop one period these last few years, i’d trap myself in between these few unexpected months of the quiet, peaceful and lonely. 

So - yes. How’s life, you ask?

pretty good :)

\*note: i recognize that i am extremely privileged, and because of that i have been able to quarantine nicely at home without much financial/other worry + unfortunately many people are not :( so yeah i did not mean to romanticize a pandemic i just felt like i liked being alone at home oops
