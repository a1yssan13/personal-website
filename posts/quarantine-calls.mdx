In the last two weeks i’ve been having a lot of long talks and calls with some friends i know very well and old friends i didn’t really expect to find again and new friends i never expected to get to know. I’m trying to think about what exactly caused this sudden influx in convos and i think it’s a mixture of me being more proactive in reaching out to other people to initiate conversations and also being forced into mandatory calls that i find pretty nice but only afterwards. 

what surprises me though is that all it really only takes is a quick text of “hey do you want to catch up!” and most of the time, they’re also down talk and so we reflect on our past and confide in one another again, and all of a sudden the distance propelled and stretched out by time seems again minuscule and unimportant. all it takes is a text and a call, which is strange because i realize now that how seemingly far and unreachable you are from others is often times really more about you than other people. 

anyway, a couple of days ago I reached out to melody and rachel and we caught up on the past couple years(hi if you’re reading this). and it was odd because it’s been seven years yet how they’ve changed and grown doesn’t strike me a bit as a surprise. In fact, they’re almost the way as i’d expect them to be, which is not a bad thing at all b/c i really missed them! and i’m also not that different in their eyes - melody says that i talk and look the same, which is true but also a little weird to consider because i feel so different than myself seven years ago. It was a little awkward at first and i tried to fill up any bits of silence as soon as i could sense them creeping up, but then it fell into a comfortable and vaguely familiar rhythm that made me feel nostalgic for the good old days when i could pet bumble bees for fun and made cringey google plus anime accounts because that was the cool thing to do. 

It’s one of those times of the month where i especially like the idea of talking to other people. Talking to other people itself is a good way to spend my time, and it doesn’t matter what we were talking about in so far as we were talking at all. it’s one of those weird phenomena like a receiving a hug that brings you comfort even though there’s really no _real_ rational reason why it should (like if you think about it, being squished from both directions by two human appendages is really fucking weird). Maybe it’s just a nice feeling to feel worthy of other people’s time in terms of a conversation or the emotional cost of upholding that conversation. 

one of the consequences of hanging out with people is that i’ve also thought about how i should be a better person to talk to. I think a lot of my friends give me generally neutral leaning negative reviews (which is overall understandable) that i’m quite scary, or i’m really blunt, or otherwise not the optimal form of a friend to look forward to conversing with. So i think a lot about how to be a better person to be friends with? and i’ve been trying to be more honest and be less overbearing and more chill but with little to minimal success so far so i honestly just need major help in the socializing department. 

In pride and prejudice darcy is a very awkward person to talk to initially and elizabeth says something like “maybe you should take your aunt’s advice and practice”. and maybe now i should begin treating conversations with other people as practice in tandem to it being a general form of entertainment because it does feel like a thing to understand and practice and probably beneficial for both me and the people around me. 

on a tangential note, I also have these quick hot and cold attitudes towards forming strong emotional attachment to people. i feel like it’s now ingrained with me to not feel emotional dependence or inflict part of your happiness on how other people act towards you but it’s also pretty obvious that the reason why that makes you tough is because people who do not love do not get hurt easily. On the other hand, i am reminded of this scene in the movie i just watched last week and this part where it’s like. 

“As wars will be fought and great loves found. And lost. And found. Lost, and found. And found. And found. And memories built upon memories until life runs on in an endless loop”

And in a way that makes me feel better about being able to form emotional attachments because idk maybe that’s the point of it all and the point of us. But still, i find myself inevitably rnr-ing and beginning to act mean to people i sense myself caring about way too much which is... still pretty deflective on my part. but maybe that’s just my personality and i can’t do anything to make me feel more comfortable about the situation. 

Probably the most healthy form of attachment though is just loving someone but a complete disregard for their behavior towards you, which is weird to think about but it’s kind of similar to loving your parents because often they get really mad at me but that’s not really an impediment in my overall emotional attitude towards them. 

Another thing i’ve realized is that now i kind of rely of giving other people gifts as the superior form of anti-isolation treatment. over quarantine, i’ve made a lot of things (making beaded bracelets, crocheting penguins, packaged gifts for other people) as a form of therapeutic relief and escape from quarantine isolation and honestly it’s surprisingly effective. When i used to feel lonely occasionally, i would just bathe in my misery and wallow or maybe wait for people to talk to me but that’s kind of petty and stupid. while giving gifts is non-intuitive its actually a great antidote to make yourself feel better. However, maybe the entire point of feeling lonely wasn’t that you really wanted to hear other people’s thoughts in the context of hanging out but for you to feel less terrible about yourself through living in the company and warmth of other people, which in that case, giving other people gifts probably makes you feel less shitty about yourself (like look! i'm such a good friend), which in turn also solves your misattributed loneliness??? I dont know man. 

there are still quite a lot of people i haven’t caught up with/want to catch up with which would be quite fun to do in the upcoming weeks. I am looking forward to talking to more people!
