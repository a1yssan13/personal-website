The last couple of days have been very snowy & cold.

This is an excerpt from a Edna St. Vincent Millay poem I heard from a podcast. I don't usually read poetry because I never felt like I could get it, but I think that this poem is very pretty and these last few days have really reminded me of these verses:

> That chill is in the air  
> Which the wise know well, and even have learned to bear.  
> This joy, I know,  
> Will soon be under snow.
> 
> The sun sets in a cloud  
> And is not seen.  
> Beauty, that spoke aloud,  
> Addresses now only the remembering ear.  
> The heart begins here  
> To feed on what has been.
> 
> Night falls fast.  
> Today is in the past.

I was thinking about this poem as I was walking across my familiar streets. It was so cold that it all just hurt, like I'd describe it as all as numbing and burning and spiky. But the world is very noticeably different when it's covered up with snow (no shit sherlock) - you can feel the texture of the powdery and plushy snow beneath your steps, the way the snow piles quietly rests on top of each and every object around you. You'd touch it, but you'd ruin the soft surface it with your roughness. You do it anyway though, because there's so much of it everywhere that you don't feel bad about it.

I feel like on snowy days there's this unexplainable nag to take advantage of the very presence of snow. As I'm looking out at this window, I can't help but feel like I'm missing out and wasting this opportunity to be doing something with it, even though I can't really pinpoint exactly what I would be doing. It's like, I want to go outside, but once I am outside, all I can think about is coming back home. So as I stare out, it's some weird combination here composed of guilt, awe, and satisfaction (?).

I think the best thing about the snow, though, is at least the way it sends me through a wave of nostalgia for a distorted, rose-colored past. When I was younger, my best friend Vicky and I would always go skiing with both of our families at Lake Tahoe, and I remember playing this dumb mobile game called "Holiday Hotel" where you collect coins for building rooms for pets and then you use those coins to build more rooms until you just build an infinite amount of rooms. It was really pointless if you really think about it, and it should've been obvious then. But I still long to play the stupid game now, even though I know it is a stupid game. Scenes of that trip flash before my head: Vicky and I discovering the delight of Altoid peppermints for the first time, because the hotel gifted them as a complementary gift, we viewed together the evergreens dusted with layers of white on the lift and giggled and gossiped about funny hypotheticals or how soft the snow looked, or the million times we fell in a pit but bounced right back up, because that was a time where we were still young enough to feel no exhaustion about general movement and life.

We rarely _choose_ by nature to remember things. Like, we never schedule out time in the morning saying "alright, at 9:30 today in the morning, I would like to choose to revisit that time on my first day of school." Rather, we almost always recall things through external stimuli, whether that's in the form of a whiff of a familiar scent, a picture, an offhand comment, a stream of consciousness that comes from something you've seen recently, or you're situated in a position that especially breeds nostalgia (the backseat of a car, at night under the covers and staring into the ceiling, or just taking a walk). Yet, in my experience, the most surefire way to go into "nostalgia mode" is through music: I think that there are certain songs associated with times in my life that I always go back to when I listen to them. I've even artificially made this easier for myself; for many years of my life, I'd take my playlists and label them by month, and sometimes, I'd just go back to listen to those months' playlist, and all my emotions and feelings for that exact month would just come crashing right back.

The catch, however, is that there is a very limited timeframe and number of times you can listen to a song before that time-transportation effect goes away. Like, "You Don't Know You're Beautiful" by 1D reminds me of laughter and playgrounds in 6th grade at some point, but it no longer does, because I've listened it tad too many times later on. "I like it that Way" by BSB reminds me of casinos and Los Vegas and my brother, but that feeling is already hazy and muffled. It's not like you can reinforce the effect a song, either, because you can never return to the time where the memory association was created. It'd be so convenient if I were to know the number countdown of each song, so I can bathe in the nostalgia and not worry about crossing that final countdown.

It's kind of wild to imagine that I can never truly go back - that some day, maybe in like 20 years, all my memories are so faded and misshapen that they're more imagination than memory.

I learned that a lot of our memories are often [false](https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-false-memories-2017-12) a couple of months ago. Like, a lot of things we vaguely remember are things that just didn't happen. This seems very reasonable, considering that a. memories exist in our head the same way that imagination exists, so that every time you imagine a hypothetical it's becomes, over time, more difficult to differentiate? b. dreams and memories have like almost no differentiation in form beyond your reason and doubt that those said dreams seem unlikely to happen. So, perhaps, the specific details I can recall of say, falling in love, or learning to ride a bike for the first time (the bike was blue, I was in a parking lot behind our apartment complex), can very be things that I conjure up or hear about because that seems like (at least, according to my brain) a better way to remember it.

So the question becomes, if us in the present have the chance of possessing faulty memories, who can really proof anything of the past existed at all?

My brother once told me that it was very possible we are put in a simulation like only moments ago (like, right now), and all of our memories and beliefs in the past were artificially uploaded in our brain by this computer system that made us believe we lived it all before. And while I don't think that the probability of this theory being true is very high, it does worry me that there's no genuine proof that anything in the past has happened. Like, beyond history textbooks, our memories, reasonable deduction from the way things are in the present, we can't really prove anything happened, right?

The way I think about it is that, if you compile every single thing I remember about my life, at maximum, I will have enough footage to fill up 1 year, because we never remember everything - only the significant moments and then occasionally one in a couple dozen insignificant days or memories. So, where did the other 17 years go, because I can't even remember me myself very well? Like, I know they existed, but nothing can really explain how and what they existed for. The question here becomes, does the past even matter, beyond how much we want it to ourselves? I guess a better way to explain it, is that if we have the power to believe in false memories, that means (for all we know) the way the past played out can be some product of our own choices right?

Recently, I discovered Vincent's (Angela's friend) blog, and he mentions that he'd rather commit all his happy memories to oblivion rather than have to go through the suffering of nostalgia. Which I totally understand, nostalgia is a form of suffering - even though it's romanticized by society as not a very harmful one.

I used to think that it didn't make a lot of sense to live in a past either. Like, why would you commit yourself into a potentially tragic past where you could otherwise forget it all and live afresh from the start? After all, it seems like the present is the part that actually matters because it's what you will actually live through in the remainder of your life. For example, Gatsby like absolutely destroys his own life by living in the past, and I don't think anyone wants to end up like Gatsby.

Yet, I'd like to believe that we are all stories, in some form or the other. Like if you think about us as a graph, I'd like to image us as recursive functions while the x-axis is time, so our past influences our trajectory as we travel through time. Even though that seems stupid (I might change my opinion soon), but I still believe in that the past is important to us as a story, even if that story is a tragedy. After all, Gatsby was great because of his tragic ending, and he would not be great had he forgot it all and moved on. Of course, that's incredibly selfish to put forth the idea that you should suffer for the sake of being a story, so I guess I'm still pretty confused about the topic.

To end this entry, I'll just store here a rant I typed out on november of 2019, which is more than a year ago:

> Its so cruel that you can only remember the things from the past, things after they have happened. Things that you know, will never, ever happen again in the exact same way. If only we could know exactly what good things we have in the future, we would be able to look at these events knowing we would be able to experience them, and apprecaite them the way they deserve. 
> 
> I always wondered where the past is stored. In the aftermath of every second, where did the previous second go? Is it stored in the pages of a history textbook, or our memories? Our memories are subjective and faulty, and a history textbook only includes so much. Perhaps one week in the last month I can’t recall what I specifically did, and it was so normal that no one would directly recall it either. Does that mean that the time last week might as well have never existed? In perhaps 30 years, few people will recall what happened under the roof of Plano West High School thirty years ago. Where will I as a 16-year-old Alyssa exist then? Just figments of nothingness buried in a couple people’s oldest recollections?
> 
> Then again, there is nothing to remorse about. We’ve always known that humanity will eventually perish, we wouldn’t matter, the universe will untangle itself and go about its business. Our fate is cruel, but even the idea of cruelness will become meaningless at some point.
