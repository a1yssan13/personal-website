TW: Thoughts about death. (not suicide, just general imaginings)

It's currently 12:30 AM (again, lmao) and I wasn't originally going to write anything tonight, but I just laid awake for 20 minutes in the dark trying to sleep, but instead of that I found myself internalizing the horrific and an uncontrollable physical and mental recoil against the notion of non-existence that accompanies similar states of mind as going to sleep. in simpler words, I was thinking about dying and how we were all dying. and so after this thought spiral enslaved my head and wouldn't let me go, I just couldn't lay awake _in that state_ so now the lights are back on, and my heartbeats recoverying a little, and the soft clacking on this keyboard is great ASMR and nice company.

i know that it is unhealthy for me to obsess over these types of thoughts, and whenever I do, I always tell myself that my emotions are only evolutionary instincts and that the actual, real and unidealized concept of nothingless is something I _should_ be indifferent towards. indifferent in the way that I feel indifferent to notions of death during daytime, or the way that movies or novel deaths do not even make me hesitate to pause to move on.

Part of the reason this blog is called "nie-hilistic" thoughts is a play on words because it's clEveR, but part of it was a consequence of my obsesion with nihilism and existentialism in books at certain earlier points in my life? I think I found comfort in hearing explicit validations that others saw the world in similar hues of pessismism that I did.

I went back on thinking about this and I think I was wrong - that I realized that my now large disinterest in existentialism is because it no longer held any real answers to these thought spirals - no book really did. in fact, my problems were never about my life being meaningful or meaningless, because that always felt like something I could figure out sooner or later on my own terms. or even if not, it was something very predictable to me, something I could form some sort of mental map (eg: I thought the meaningless of life was something very conceptualizable ??) Rather, I was obsessed with the unknown instead: this instinctive fear of being nothing - of every conscious part of me vanishing - which is odd because I tell myself that that's what sleep definitionally is? I tell myself that and of course I'm instantaneously terrified of sleeping and now here I am, 1:00 am now, clammering away on this post that's pretty useless anyway but hey, at least it serves as a distraction for me.

a lot of my friends do not understand these thoguhts I have. in fact I would say that most of my friends I've confided in before cannot relate much at all, and I am extremely jealous of that but c'est la vie.

most of my friends are in fact the opposite in that they feel like death is something that they are fine with and "are peace at", and I even see this depiction very common

anyway, how I would describe it? imagine you are on a bike, and you're actually really really shitty at riding bikes, but youre conveniently on this pretty thin shaky road and then suddenly you jerk your handlebars right accidentally. and now FUCK you're off the road and just rolling down this MASSIVE hill, and you're accelerating fast-paced on down this very rocky slope and you can't control anything because as stated before you're very shitty at riding bikes. and all you can do is grasp onto the handles with your dear life to watch the scenery whiz by at incredibally scary speed and at the beginning it's a very panicky because you're like - aw ffFFUCK i am fucked but slowly you just accept the fact that you have to crash inevitably and just brace yourself for the fall and close your eyes and try not to think about it but the panic comes in waves because you know that not thinking about it is a form of thinking about it and that even if you manage to it is just escapism and changes nothing and it's all over in a few minutes or two and oh gosh you just have to accept it and BAM you crash.

alternatively the analogy here can be you're on this really scary winding roads that are on the edge of a cliff but here you're driving this bus on that said cliff, but one wrong jerk has happened and now you're rolling off the roads and down the cliff and you have a couple minutes to reconcile with the fact that you cannot escape and you are suffocating and drowning in the ocean.

so yeah as an explanation, we are born on that out-of-control state on the bike? rolling down the hill = our scarily fast progression of the stage of how lives/time progression --> we have no control in the fact that we are all marching towards the future at a terribly fast speed. crash = us dying at some point in an inevitable way. me feeling this way = every couple of days when i am restless (like obviously i do not feel this way all day or even most of the time).

my solution at the end of all of this and what i arrive at is that i would just like to squeeze someone's hand to know that i am alive. like, i know fully well that does not solve any of my mental barriers, but I guess it's just nice to have someone's presence to try to fill that terrible solititude and emptiness that accompanies these types of thoughts.

a more feasible troubleshooting here points to the root core issue, which is just that I am not busy enough in my day-to-day schedule. I know this is extremely contradictory because I just wrote a couple days ago that chilling in quarantine is such a vibe. but if this is the side effect that comes along with it, I realize now my grave miscalculation is that i did not take that into account. and I think I should return back to grinding work during the day so my mind is too fatigued to wander around aimlessly like this at night.

creds to angela for the nice title ty
