It suddenly occurred to me that because I am technically a blogger now, I supposedly “write” quite often. It doesn’t actually feel like I write write, because I don’t really think about how to make these blog posts “good writing”. As in, I just write whatever the fuck I want, whereas if I were at school completing an assignment, I’d deliberately insert some pretty ~vernacular~ and/or similes and/or alliterations—I don't know, I’d probably overthink each and every paragraph.  

In all honesty, I don’t think I’m very good at writing; I never took it seriously as a skill to improve upon beyond finishing my assigned essays to the best of my ability. I’m not exactly a bad writer (?) either. I mostly say things the way that I’ll talk about them if you were sitting in front of me, and I’d say them in a way I would if I wasn’t really considering social norms and I had just drunk a large dose of truth serum. They are more or less blunt, straight to the point, and not really flowery or strikingly metaphorical (which are usually good qualities I look out for in books that make me feel the feels, if you know what I mean). 

I really wish I was good at writing though. Whenever I read a really good quote in a book, I feel as if I was suddenly understood in a very rare and profound and intimate way, which makes me feel very grateful to general universal spirits and of course the author. That’s not how my writing makes other people feel—at least as of now—although I hope it will someday. 

I used to hate everything that had to do with like, liberal arts and language and whatever crap they taught you at school. Mostly, this was just a consequence of my teachers grading my essays in a way I couldn’t understand even with the rubric, and then showing me examples of stuff I didn’t fuck with as the standard for “good essays”—to describe it, they were like pretentiously written with an unnecessarily high concentration of complex vocab, probably all done with the aid of a thesaurus. I also hated that I couldn’t really control my grade, in the way that I could “control” my grade in math and science, which led me to believe that I was naturally un-talented in the fields of writing and reading, and I think a lot of asian kids also seem to feel that way as evidenced by our conversations on this subject. 

I’d like to get better at it now, maybe take some writing classes at Penn if I have time (but considering I’m doing a double major that seems like a pipe dream at this point). I’ve been kind of just, trying to discover things I love doing that really don't involve my career and what people expect of me, because that seems like a good way of living life that I won’t regret when I’m older. 

I often scroll through other people’s blogs and admire the way they choose every word to use and their sentence syntax—their diction, the preciseness of their vocabulary, the way their brains processes their thoughts in such artistic or mathematical ways. It doesn’t make me feel insecure as much as it inspires me to do better; I actually appreciate that about writing. It feels like most other things I do are classified as somewhat zero sum, which definitely makes me feel like shit sometimes, but writing isn’t like that at all. Writing isn’t like that in the same way that humor and gift giving and making art isn’t like that. 

But, more than anything else, writing and reading is just another way to remind me that other people are their own _alive_ beings with their own unique settings, their own contexts and environments, their own million thoughts that swarm incessantly around their heads, thoughts that none of us other outsiders will likely ever access. And I really like that idea, because everything feels much less terribly isolating when you realize that everyone else is just like you, even though you differ in the slight ways in terms of your beliefs or your goals or your personalities, etc but in reality most of us are just dealing with this same weird situation of our brain and our consciousness and we’re all just sort of struggling together in this world that none of us really chose to be born into. 

So I’ll keep doing it until maybe one day I change my mind and feel like expressing myself is an inefficient use of my time or attention, and maybe by then this blog would no longer exist. Maybe I’ll never have enough time for it, which in that case, I’ll be pretty upset by because that means I probably became a job sellout/productivity maniac. You never really know, and I can’t tell if this is one of the things I just impulsively start and let die out or if I’ll consistently keep up with.
