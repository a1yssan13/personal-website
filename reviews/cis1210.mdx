I took this class Spring 2021, directly after CIS 1600. Since this is a mandatory class for both CIS majors/minors, most people have to take it anyway, but I highly recommend it!  

In fact, I liked this class so much that I came back to TA this class the following semester. For me, this was a class that was so well organized: in many CIS classes, the lecture, recitation, and homeworks were synchronized so they covered the exact same content (unlike many CIS classes after this). Like CIS 1600, this isn't a memorization-based course. You have to think pretty hard and demonstrate understanding to do well, and I found each problem set/recitation/exam really interesting to do. 

In Spring 2022, our professor sped through the content much faster than was planned on the schedule, so we got exposure to topics like sublinear programming, randomized algorithms, and other more niche data structures like AVL/Red Black Trees. I'm not a great lecture attender (I probably went to around 50% of the lectures), but CIS 1210 has possibly one of the best documented course notes. I'm particularly a fan of this and think every course should do this. I think for a lot of people who have attention problems (like me) and learn much better through reading, publishing full course notes is the lowest hanging fruit to help both students (and TAs) engage with the material much further in depth. 

Also, Professor Rajiv teaches rather fast: I like this because I find it engaging and he's also very interactive (ie cold calls on students).

Difficulty/Time: There are two types of homeworks: programming and writing, usually one type a week but there are approximately 2 homeworks where you have to do both. Programming for me took 4-7 hours per homework, and written would take approximately 3-5 hours per homework. I think CIS 1210 took significantly less time on average per week for me than CIS 1600, but I think this varies depending on person.

Pros: 
- The TAs on staff are generally very passionate about this class. During my time teaching, I was surprised by how strongly people argued about alternative solutions or grading rubrics. This means 1) attending recitations is usually more rewarding because usually the TAs are somewhat invested in teaching well 2) TAs care a lot about the *right* solutions, meaning you are not penalized (that much) over unique and alternative ideas. 
- The tests have a very low average, but the curves are very generous. This gives you an opportunity to be challenged and increases the ceiling without making it more stressful since everyone does pretty poorly :) 
- Obviously a very, very useful class for recruiting purposes

Cons: 
- Office Hours, especially at the beginning of the year, can reach 40-50 people and wait times might reach 1-2 hours. 
- Weird regrading policy in my opinion where your entire exam/homework is regraded when you submit a regrade request for a single question, which dissuades too many regrades especially for alternative solutions. I personally believed that regrades should be encouraged because it's a really helpful learning tool to understand mistakes, but that's just the way the course works. 
- The way the homeworks and tests are graded can feel very arbitrary at times. TAs put a large emphasis on grading *fairly*, so every student is evaluated strictly on the same metric. This often means they sacrifice metrics that make sense. For instance, the omission of a single line can be worth 50% of the points, even though you demonstrated understanding of the concept in a different way. 

Overall, besides a little semantical grading things, this is a really rewarding class that stands as many people's favorite class they've taken.
